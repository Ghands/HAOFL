ent_0 broke the news that the star 's yin and yang contract may cause a major earthquake in the entertainment industry . on june 2nd , ent_0 once again posted on weibo that he once again broke the " large and small contract " : the small one was a performance of 2 million , the big one was a planned producer of 7.48 million plus 900,000 , and took another sack of cash . and in the tone of his own pet cat , he hinted that he might be threatened because of this : someone always told my shovel officer to be careful and safe , and i had to hide . on the same day , renmin.com also published a comment on " why are star pays repeatedly " limited " and high " , and started discussions around the high star pays and supported ent_0 . the high pay of celebrities reflects the false fire of the film and television industry . as long as such an evaluation mechanism has not changed and such a business format has not changed , despite the various " restrictions " , the star 's high remuneration may also appear in various forms of " large and small contracts " . as the saying goes , there are countermeasures under the policies , and the phenomenon of high pay in the entertainment industry has to be changed from the roots . with the continuous fermentation of public opinion , it has attracted the attention of relevant authorities . on june 3 , the state administration of taxation instructed tax authorities in jiangsu and other places to investigate the issue of " yin and yang contracts " in the entertainment industry . in addition , wuxi local tax issued a weibo to confirm this news , and said : according to the requirements of relevant departments , investigations have been carried out according to law to verify that any violation of tax laws and regulations will be handled in strict accordance with the law ( the reason for wuxi local tax is because fan bingbing himself the studio in wuxi ) since the intervention of wuxi local tax investigation , the personal grievances of ent_0 and fan bingbing and others have been more than gossip in the entertainment industry , it has risen to the legal level . ent_0 also changed from a protagonist to a real - name whistleblower . in an exclusive interview with the reporter of " daily economic news " , ent_0 also said that he is coordinating with the competent department to meet specific details such as how to obtain evidence . it is estimated that there will be relevant news in about a week . " what are the consequences of the irs 's involvement in the investigation ? in this way , ent_0 tears away not only his own scars , but also the hidden rule of the entertainment circle - the yin yang contract . what is the yin yang contract ? refers to the parties to the contract to conclude more than two contracts with different contents on the same matter , one internally and one externally , and the external one is not the real intention of both parties , but for the purpose of evading national taxes ; the copy is the true meaning of both parties , which can be written or oral . it can be seen that the signing of the yin - yang contract is an act that violates national interests and violates national laws . according to article 201 of the criminal law : " taxpayers deceive and conceal means of making false tax declarations or not reporting , and evading the payment of a large amount of tax and accounting for more than 10 % of the taxable amount , shall be punished with imprisonment or detention of less than 3 years , and a fine ; a huge amount and accounting for more than 30 % of the taxable amount , punishable by imprisonment of more than 3 years and less than 7 years , and fines . after the tax authority issues a recovery notice in accordance with the law , it shall make up for the tax payable and pay the overdue payment , and if it has already received an administrative penalty , it shall not be investigated for criminal responsibility . however , within 5 years , except for criminal punishment for evading payment of taxes or being granted more than two administrative punishments by the tax authority , according to the interpretation of an authoritative jurist , once the tax authority determines that the yin - yang contract exists objectively and is suspected of tax evasion , the relevant department will order the payment and pay the late fee , the suspected crime will be transferred to the public security organ . the problem of tax evasion and tax evasion is by no means the first case in the entertainment industry . after all , human nature is greedy , and no one will think of giving up money to make more money . you can use these stars as a reference to compare . mao amin , the predecessor of the music scene , made 60,000 yuan in 5 days and 40,000 yuan in tax evasion when he performed in heilongjiang in 1989 , and was fined more than 600,000 yuan by the relevant tax authorities . as a result , mao amin 's singing career was affected , and she almost fell into disrepute . in 2002 , the problem of tax evasion and evasion by liu xiaoqing caused a sensation throughout the country . as a popular star , income should be considerable . beijing xiaoqing culture and art co. , ltd . , founded by her first hand , evaded taxes and evaded taxes of more than 10 million yuan , and the amount of money involved was large . of course , it is difficult to escape from prison . since then , liu xiaoqing 's scandalous scandal has been written into the middle school 's political textbooks , and has become a stain that can not be erased for a lifetime . in 2008 , lin zhiling was on the list of taiwanese artists ' tax reimbursement on suspicion of untrue tax breaks , and the fine amount was 2.5 million us dollars . lin zhiling has not yet responded to this matter . not only in china , but also abroad . the famous korean film star song hui qiao qiaomei , because of the amount of tax evasion and tax evasion reached 2.575 billion won , paid a huge amount of tax . paying taxes is an obligation that every chinese citizen should fulfill . as a star with its own halo , which is sought after and loved by millions of people , it should be a pioneer . the truth will be late , but it will never be absent . i believe that with the investigation of the relevant departments and the assistance of ent_0 , things will soon fall into place , and the phenomenon of high prices in the entertainment industry can be contained . this world is always malicious towards those who dare to tell the truth . this afternoon , ent_0 posted on weibo that he was threatened with death by real - name authentication . this article titled " ent_0 has the right to conduct a moral trial is the first layer " comes from the international test pilot xu yongling . in this article , we can clearly see that " killing mad dogs " and " yangshou is not much " are extremely malicious . use words . for ent_0 , this is not the first time he has received a similar " death threat " , and he has been surrounded by danger since he chose to be a man of truth . in 2013 , ent_0 and fang zhouzi started a " discussion " about whether to eat genetically modified food . for ent_0 , this war against interest groups is undoubtedly long and dangerous . people believe that food is the top priority . he believes that genetically modified food is not inedible , but is subject to standard testing . consumers have the right to know whether the food they buy is genetically modified food . in order to be able to speak with evidence and facts , he did not hesitate to investigate in the united states at his own expense and shoot records at his own expense . it is said that before going to the united states , someone had given him a sealing fee of 200 million yuan , and ent_0 was unimpressed . because he just wanted to give the general public a truth , except for these , there is no benefit at all . however , all he got from doing this was threats and revenge , so that he had to be on guard at all times , and even stay away from family and friends to ensure their safety . even so , ent_0 never gave up his resistance , so far he is still a reversal fighter ! this time , ent_0 broke the news that the yin - yang contract involves the entire entertainment circle . the people involved behind us can not be imagined , but it should not be inferior to the interest group behind the genetic modification . however , when ent_0 faced this threat again , he also did not flinch and told the reporter that he would actively cooperate with the relevant tax authorities ' investigation . chai jing once said : ent_0 is the only person awake in this era . it 's not easy to be a sober person who does n't care about personal safety . for all this , he has long been able to ignore the fame and fortune and live his uncontested life , but he finally chose the most dangerous way - to expose the truth . more than half a year later , his original heart has not changed . he is the one who has always cherished the greatest goodwill in this society .

langfang , hebei : who is in control of the violation of the 3rd building of " daxinxincheng " in anci district \ n \ n ( reporter : li junqiang , yang shengling ) the construction bureau of anci district , langfang city , hebei province , tendered for the project without land and planning procedures and filed . the developer used the notice of illegal bid to deceive the construction party to invest a lot of money in the project . after the incident was revealed , the developer violently drove the construction party out of the site . who is responsible for the heavy losses of the construction party ? \ n \ naccording to the construction contractor ent_0 , 2012 in july , the second phase of the new town new town phase ii project in anci district , langfang city , developed by langfang everyone commercial city development co. , ltd . , was shut down by the local land planning department during construction due to the lack of legal procedures . \ n \ nafter the shutdown , ent_0 learned that building a3 had no land and planning permit and start - up permit , and rejected the developer 's request to continue the construction of building a3 # according to law , and requested langfang city commercial city development co. , ltd . to settle the construction funds of the a3 # building have been rejected after several negotiations , on the grounds that the a3 # building project has not reached the payment stage . as a result , funds were broken and other legal projects were forced to stop . in november of the same year , developers used violent means to drive construction workers out of the field . \ n \ nit caused an economic loss of more than 40 million yuan , which made the wages of nearly 300 migrant workers unable to be paid in full . at the same time , he paid the rmb 2 million wage guarantee for migrant workers in the name of fujian xinji construction group to the construction bureau of anci district , langfang city . \ n \ nin the past few years , ent_0 has repeatedly asked developers to settle the project funds according to law , but he failed to seek legal assistance . however , he was unable to pay huge litigation fees and recovered legal income . \ n \ nit is reported that china 's " urban and rural planning law " and " construction law " and other regulations clearly stipulate that construction projects that have not obtained construction engineering planning permits are not allowed to bid or bid , let alone record construction contracts and start construction too . \ n \ nwhat is puzzling is how can the construction bureau of anci district , langfang city , as the government 's construction engineering supervision department , bid for illegal projects that have not obtained construction project planning permission ? for the record of the illegal contract contract for permits ? \ n \ nin order to clarify the truth , on january 22 , 2016 , the reporter went to langfang city to interview the director of the anci district construction bureau . the director told reporters that because of time constraints , before the unified bidding was conducted in july 2011 , the planning bureau issued a certificate proving that the approval procedures for the a3 # building have been completed . \ n \ nin addition , everyone 's new city phase ii development project is to move back to the building . i am afraid that people will not be satisfied for a long time . in order not to affect the progress of the project , plus the certification of the planning bureau , a unified tender was conducted . \ n \ nhowever , it is difficult for reporters to understand that a paper certificate of the planning bureau can be greater than the national legal requirements ? without a planning permit and land use certificate , only one paper certificate can be used . implement unified bidding for engineering projects ? \ n \ naccording to the information provided by the construction bureau to the public security bureau on december 25 , 2014 in the description of everyone 's new city a1-a5 # building , it was clearly stated that four months after bidding , the a3 # building has not yet obtained land and planning and other related procedures . \ n \ none of the two materials said that the approval procedures for building a3 # were complete , and the certificate was issued . the other said that the a3 # building has not yet obtained land and planning and other related procedures 4 months after bidding for the a1-a5 # building in the new city . \ n \ nask whether the a3 # building has obtained the land and planning and other related procedures when you bid for a1-a5 # in the new city . which of the two documents with the completely opposite contents is fake ? what is the purpose of the fraud ? \ n \ nwhen the reporter asked when chen jiu 's 2 million yuan migrant worker 's wage bond could be refunded , the director replied : according to the regulations it should not be refunded until the overall project is completed and accepted . \ n \ naccording to the survey , the a1-a5 # building in xincheng was completed in 2013 and delivered to the owner in 2013 . why has n't the completion acceptance been carried out so far ? what are the reasons for not completing the completion acceptance ? if the developer 's illegal construction project can not be accepted , will the construction worker 's wage deposit refunded by the construction party be not far away ? \ n \ nmigrant workers ' wage guarantee , therefore , it is set up to protect the legal income of migrant workers . it is not a project quality deposit and should not be involved in project acceptance . as long as the project is completed and the construction staff leaves the site , there should be no refund of the payment of the deposit within a certain time . . what is involved in project acceptance ? \ n \ nthe construction bureau is a national government agency that specializes in managing urban construction , and is a government agency that implements laws and regulations formulated by the government . official documents issued by government agencies have absolute credibility for the general public degrees , if the official documents of government agencies contain false elements , they are also extremely deceptive . \ n \ nanci district construction bureau concealed the fact that the no . 3 building project had not obtained the land use permit , planning permit truth , illegal bidding for the developer , and filing was absolutely deceptive . this kind of deceit seriously damaged the image and credibility of the government ! \ n \ naccording to the construction contractor ent_0 , it was precisely the " construction bid notice for fujian xinji construction group co. , ltd . " " and the construction contract were reviewed and filed before we believed the legality of this project . obtained the trust of construction contractor ent_0 and signed a construction subcontract with fujian xinji construction group co. , ltd . on the construction of the a1a5 # building in the new city . caused heavy losses and lost capital . \ n \ nthe media will continue to pay attention to the progress of this incident . \ n \ neditor : wang bo \ n \ nresponsible editor : liu lingmin

" lao lu shed tears when he said these words . next , a more sad scene appeared : old lu said , kneeling behind his daughter , holding both hands to grab xiao li 's leg . \ tthe policeman beside him shook his head and sighed . \ tunbearable : four years of seeking women 's tears have been crying \ tbecause xiaoli has emotional conflicts with the parents who took her home , the police temporarily separated the two parties and accompanied xiaoli to the case handling center inventory related items . the old lu family stood outside the door and waited anxiously with sadness . \ tlao lu said , " just like this daughter , she has been away from home for 4 years . my mother and i have been struggling to hear her news . " \ tlao lu 's home is in guigang , guangxi the city of ent_0 in the countryside . her daughter xiaoli had been admitted to a university in yizhou , jiangxi in the summer of 2011 , but she did n't study anymore until she was in the third grade . " after returning home from her sophomore summer , she suddenly told her home that she would go to shenzhen to do a clothing business and find a home for 20,000 yuan . our family is not rich , but she still respects her ideas and gives her money to let her go . shenzhen , " said lu . \ t " i want to come now , maybe she was deceived by mlm at that time . " lao lu said that after her daughter arrived in shenzhen , she almost lost contact with her family , could not make a phone call , and did not return home during the spring festival . second she suddenly called her family back in 2013 and said that she would ask for another 3,000 yuan to do business .

" \ tafter the request for money was rejected , xiaoli almost lost contact with her family for the next two years . since last year , xiao li suddenly called back and asked her father and mother about their health . the old lu couple surprised their daughter with the news , and asked her to come back quickly , but the daughter refused . the couple was helpless , and finally the mother cried and begged her daughter to tell the work place , " you ca n't go back , will my dad and i go to see you ? " \ tthe daughter still refuses to say the place , leaving the parents at home all day wash your face with tears . \ tuntil the 15th of this month , the old lu couple suddenly received a phone call from jingzhou city , hubei province . the previous conjecture turned out to be a reality , and her daughter was detained in a detention center for mlm . \ t " this time she knew her daughter 's letter of approval , and waited for her detention to come to pick her up . she did n't expect that she was trapped in mlm and was so brainwashed . " lao lu said sadly . \ t " we did n't expect this ending , if she did n't repent , please ask the police at the police station and then close the detention center .

in the early morning of may 27 , 2015 , a 60-year - old man was hanged on the gate of gujiao city government in gujiao city , shanxi province . soon after , his son was arrested by the local police on suspicion of abandonment . at present , the court has opened a court but has not yet issued a sentence . an investigation by a reporter from the china business daily found that before his suicide , this father had been cancelled for his " dibao " and repeatedly asked the relevant departments to recover , but to no avail . the survival condition of his son , who was arrested by the police , is equally astonishing . november 3 , gujiao city , shanxi province . in the morning before winter , it is already very cold . the sky outside was dim , accompanied by a burst of northeast wind , whistling , not knowing which corner to blow to , and occasionally making a harsh whistle . in the ten - square - meter house that ent_0 rented , there is still some warmth . the glass on the window of the hut produced some mist , which made people look hazy from the inside out . also unclear is the cause of death of his father , ent_1 - a 60-year - old man who is less than one meter in height , thin , and usually wears a blue tunic suit , hangs strangely on the city government door . the sixty - year - old man hanged himself on the iron gate of the city government after his father committed suicide , ent_0 was arrested and prosecuted for suspected abandonment . he is currently in jail . most of the stories about the father and son come from relatives . at 8 pm on may 26 , 2015 , 26-year - old ent_0 sold fruits on the stall . father ent_1 , 60 years old , did not know when to appear in front of the fruit stand , and asked his son not to accept the stand so late . ent_0 said that it would be sold after a while . at this time , when someone came to buy fruit , ent_0 greeted the customer . my father ate a crispy melon ( melon ) at the stall , and he left sometime . this is the last side of him and his father . at about 9 am the next morning , ent_0 received a call from the police and said that his father committed suicide . ent_0 could n't believe it . he immediately called his mother , who comforted him , " impossible . " ent_0 then rushed to the gujiao public security bureau . a policeman named " guo yongwang " said that ent_1 was taken to the hospital morgue at 6 am . the police found a nokia phone and i d card on ent_1 . at this time , another policeman on the scene reprimanded ent_0 , " you are a crime of abandonment , you do n't care about your laozi ( dialect , father ) , he hanged him " . what happened afterwards , ent_0 told uncle yue buwang . on november 3 , yue buwang relayed some of ent_0 's later experiences to a reporter from the china business daily . ent_0 saw from the surveillance video at the door of gujiao city government that it was 3:20 in the morning of may 27 , and his father was still wandering in front of the city government . the police showed ent_0 a photo of his father when he committed suicide . the photo shows that his father hangs on the iron gate of the city government . the rope around his neck is a nylon rope tied to a can . the neck is lined with toilet paper . ent_1 is facing the door , his feet are only more than ten centimeters away from the ground . looking at this picture , ent_0 quickly took the phone and took it . but in the end , the phone was taken by the police , and after deleting the photo , he gave it back to him . after the son claimed to be innocent and refused to obtain bail pending trial , the family experienced the most difficult days . ent_0 's mother yue dongye said that after learning of the bad news , ent_0 was dizzy , especially with a sore throat , and was soon hospitalized . on may 29th , local public security , civil affairs , and rural cadres and many others came to yuedongye to rent a house in gujiao city to learn about ent_1 's life . prior to this , yue dongye and her husband had been divorced for many years , and it was difficult to take care of the matter of the ex - husband . they could only look after ent_0 's two children as much as possible , so they did n't know much . on june 4 , when ent_0 went to the township government to ask a solution to his father 's problems , a police officer suddenly found him and said that a deputy director of the gujiao city public security bureau asked him to talk to him . subsequently , ent_0 was taken away from the township government . the next day , ent_0 's family was informed by the public security bureau that ent_0 was suspected of abandoning and was detained by the criminal police brigade of gujiao public security bureau . as soon as his father died , his son was detained . ent_0 's wife did n't work , and on weekdays , she relied on her husband to set aside a little bit of income to subsidize the family . this time , the entire family collapsed . the two children in the family , a 6-year - old sister and a 2- and a half - year - old brother , cry every day to ask for dad . later , my sister did not know where she heard that her father had gone to the police station . as soon as someone asked her where her father had gone , she said that she had gone to the police station . ent_0 was detained for a few days , and the leaders of the xingjiashe township government brought a message to ent_0 's family and asked them to write an application for bail pending trial . yue dongye said that the leadership of the township government also emphasized that the bail pending trial should be specially guaranteed , " ent_1 's family members can not petition and ask the government for compensation . " on november 3 , a reporter from china business daily saw this application signed by many of ent_0 's family members . the application clearly mentions not asking for compensation from the government and petitioning . however , the wang family has not waited until their loved ones are released on bail , and some people in the government have said , " ent_0 refused to be released on bail . he said he was not guilty . " the house became " wandering " without his home . the ex - husband committed suicide and his son was detained . this makes yue dongye , 55 , think this home is unfortunate . the source of this misfortune started from the change of marriage 30 years ago . yue dongye was 25 years old , because her brother could not find a wife , she married ent_1 in the neighboring village . in exchange , ent_1 's sister married yue dongye 's brother . after getting married , yue dongye found that her husband was not a diligent person . " the farm work that a man can do in a day can take three days for her husband to complete . " after that , their two daughters and a son were born one after another . the second daughter , wang lizhen , 29 , remembers clearly that when she was seven or eight years old , one day when her father walked from the house to the door , the house collapsed . at that time , she was in the house with her sister and mother , but fortunately they were all safe and sound . since then , the " home " in wang lizhen 's memory has been wandering . there was no house to live in . the kind neighbors took them in , and the family moved to the neighbor 's excess house . after living for a few years , the neighbor 's son was about to get married and moved out again . in 2002 , looking at the poor economic conditions at home , yue dongye entered the city as a nanny . 13-year - old ent_0 also dropped out of school and began to wander in society , sometimes working part - time in internet cafes , and sometimes working as a messenger in the cafeteria . in 2008 , ent_0 talked about a girlfriend , and the two soon decided to get married . on the wedding day , the relatives of ent_1 and yue dongye fought because of something . this frame eventually led to the divorce of ent_1 and yue dongye . due to divorce , yue dongye gave up all the property in the family . but in fact , this family has no property to divide . after the divorce , yue dongye and his second daughter lived in gujiao city . the house that ent_0 rents is very close to his mother and often goes to his mother 's house to eat mixed meals . and ent_1 , after moving away from the neighbor 's house , first borrowed the house of another villager , and after that , the house collapsed , and he began a journey to feed his single while working , and was approaching this house . the farther away . he and his son have lived in a bad family 's house . in the eyes of his ex - wife and two daughters , ent_1 is not a diligent person . yue dongye even described the ex - husband as " loose and leisurely , " " the money he earns ca n't support himself , and a little money is spent on eating and smoking . " actually , ent_1 did n't make much money . ent_1 , who is working outside , is to show people the door , or help others to raise livestock such as pigs and sheep . during this time , he also suffered from cerebral infarction and was hospitalized three times . chen runxiao , the former village party secretary of the village of chenjiashe where ent_1 is located , told the china business daily that in 2007 , when he was the village party secretary , ent_1 was given a " minimum living allowance " considering that he had a cerebral infarction and no housing . " dibao " has been received since 2008 . after chen runxiao ceased to serve as the village party secretary in 2009 , he did not know whether ent_1 was still enjoying the " minimum security " treatment . when a reporter from the china business daily interviewed in gujiao city , most of the interviewees believed that the reason for ent_1 's suicide was that his " minimum living allowance " was inexplicably cancelled three years ago . from the perspective of his ex - wife yue dongye , the minimum guarantee of more than 1,000 yuan per year is life - saving money for ent_1 . ent_1 also went to live with his son , but his son 's life is not much better . shortly after marriage , ent_0 started selling fruit on the floor . later , after giving birth to a son and a daughter , a family of 4 rented in a private house of less than 20 square meters in the north of gujiao city . a reporter from the china business daily saw in a private house that two beds , one large and one small , occupied nearly a third of the space in the house . the two electrical appliances at home were the tv set and the washing machine . the landlord told the visiting reporter that the monthly rent for this room is only more than 100 yuan , but even so , the family has owed rent for nearly a year . occasionally , ent_1 went to help his son to look after the fruit stand.many people who are familiar with the father and son signed the certificate . in 2013 , ent_0 rented a house to live with his father , but a few months later , ent_1 went to help his cousin again , so he did not live with his son . in march and april of this year , uncle yuebuwang saw at ent_0 's fruit stand that ent_0 was giving his father pocket money . at that time , yue buwang was angry and scolded his former brother - in - law , " it 's not easy for a child to support the family and live a life . you are so kind to ask him for money " ? ent_1 left silently . no one knows where he lives . yue buwang felt that ent_1 should live in a part - time job . if there is really no place to live , go to the guest house , you can live for more than ten dollars a day . although in the eyes of his family , ent_1 is not diligent , even a little idle . however , in chen runxiao 's view , the facts may not be all this way . " after getting a cerebral infarction , people will not be able to work , and people will be weak .

in the early morning of may 27 , 2015 , a 60-year - old man was hanged on the gate of gujiao city government in gujiao city , shanxi province . soon after , his son was arrested by the local police on suspicion of abandonment . at present , the court has opened a court but has not yet issued a sentence . an investigation by a reporter from the china business daily found that before his suicide , this father had been cancelled for his " dibao " and repeatedly asked the relevant departments to recover , but to no avail . the survival condition of his son , who was arrested by the police , is equally astonishing . november 3 , gujiao city , shanxi province . in the morning before winter , it is already very cold . the sky outside was dim , accompanied by a burst of northeast wind , whistling , not knowing which corner to blow to , and occasionally making a harsh whistle . in the ten - square - meter house that ent_0 rented , there is still some warmth . the glass on the window of the hut produced some mist , which made people look hazy from the inside out . also unclear is the cause of death of his father , ent_1 - a 60-year - old man who is less than one meter in height , thin , and usually wears a blue tunic suit , hangs strangely on the city government door . the sixty - year - old man hanged himself on the iron gate of the city government after his father committed suicide , ent_0 was arrested and prosecuted for suspected abandonment . he is currently in jail . most of the stories about the father and son come from relatives . at 8 pm on may 26 , 2015 , 26-year - old ent_0 sold fruits on the stall . father ent_1 , 60 years old , did not know when to appear in front of the fruit stand , and asked his son not to accept the stand so late . ent_0 said that it would be sold after a while . at this time , when someone came to buy fruit , ent_0 greeted the customer . my father ate a crispy melon ( melon ) at the stall , and he left sometime . this is the last side of him and his father . at about 9 am the next morning , ent_0 received a call from the police and said that his father committed suicide . ent_0 could n't believe it . he immediately called his mother , who comforted him , " impossible . " ent_0 then rushed to the gujiao public security bureau . a policeman named " guo yongwang " said that ent_1 was taken to the hospital morgue at 6 am . the police found a nokia phone and i d card on ent_1 . at this time , another policeman on the scene reprimanded ent_0 , " you are a crime of abandonment , you do n't care about your laozi ( dialect , father ) , he hanged him " . what happened afterwards , ent_0 told uncle yue buwang . on november 3 , yue buwang relayed some of ent_0 's later experiences to a reporter from the china business daily . ent_0 saw from the surveillance video at the door of gujiao city government that it was 3:20 in the morning of may 27 , and his father was still wandering in front of the city government . the police showed ent_0 a photo of his father when he committed suicide . the photo shows that his father hangs on the iron gate of the city government . the rope around his neck is a nylon rope tied to a can . the neck is lined with toilet paper . ent_1 is facing the door , his feet are only more than ten centimeters away from the ground . looking at this picture , ent_0 quickly took the phone and took it . but in the end , the phone was taken by the police , and after deleting the photo , he gave it back to him . after the son claimed to be innocent and refused to obtain bail pending trial , the family experienced the most difficult days . ent_0 's mother yue dongye said that after learning of the bad news , ent_0 was dizzy , especially with a sore throat , and was soon hospitalized . on may 29th , local public security , civil affairs , and rural cadres and many others came to yuedongye to rent a house in gujiao city to learn about ent_1 's life . prior to this , yue dongye and her husband had been divorced for many years , and it was difficult to take care of the matter of the ex - husband . they could only look after ent_0 's two children as much as possible , so they did n't know much . on june 4 , when ent_0 went to the township government to ask a solution to his father 's problems , a police officer suddenly found him and said that a deputy director of the gujiao city public security bureau asked him to talk to him . subsequently , ent_0 was taken away from the township government . the next day , ent_0 's family was informed by the public security bureau that ent_0 was suspected of abandoning and was detained by the criminal police brigade of gujiao public security bureau . as soon as his father died , his son was detained . ent_0 's wife did n't work , and on weekdays , she relied on her husband to set aside a little bit of income to subsidize the family . this time , the entire family collapsed . the two children in the family , a 6-year - old sister and a 2- and a half - year - old brother , cry every day to ask for dad . later , my sister did not know where she heard that her father had gone to the police station . as soon as someone asked her where her father had gone , she said that she had gone to the police station . ent_0 was detained for a few days , and the leaders of the xingjiashe township government brought a message to ent_0 's family and asked them to write an application for bail pending trial . yue dongye said that the leadership of the township government also emphasized that the bail pending trial should be specially guaranteed , " ent_1 's family members can not petition and ask the government for compensation . " on november 3 , a reporter from china business daily saw this application signed by many of ent_0 's family members . the application clearly mentions not asking for compensation from the government and petitioning . however , the wang family has not waited until their loved ones are released on bail , and some people in the government have said , " ent_0 refused to be released on bail . he said he was not guilty . " the house became " wandering " without his home . the ex - husband committed suicide and his son was detained . this makes yue dongye , 55 , think this home is unfortunate . the source of this misfortune started from the change of marriage 30 years ago . yue dongye was 25 years old , because her brother could not find a wife , she married ent_1 in the neighboring village . in exchange , ent_1 's sister married yue dongye 's brother . after getting married , yue dongye found that her husband was not a diligent person . " the farm work that a man can do in a day can take three days for her husband to complete . " after that , their two daughters and a son were born one after another . the second daughter , wang lizhen , 29 , remembers clearly that when she was seven or eight years old , one day when her father walked from the house to the door , the house collapsed . at that time , she was in the house with her sister and mother , but fortunately they were all safe and sound . since then , the " home " in wang lizhen 's memory has been wandering . there was no house to live in . the kind neighbors took them in , and the family moved to the neighbor 's excess house . after living for a few years , the neighbor 's son was about to get married and moved out again . in 2002 , looking at the poor economic conditions at home , yue dongye entered the city as a nanny . 13-year - old ent_0 also dropped out of school and began to wander in society , sometimes working part - time in internet cafes , and sometimes working as a messenger in the cafeteria . in 2008 , ent_0 talked about a girlfriend , and the two soon decided to get married . on the wedding day , the relatives of ent_1 and yue dongye fought because of something . this frame eventually led to the divorce of ent_1 and yue dongye . due to divorce , yue dongye gave up all the property in the family . but in fact , this family has no property to divide . after the divorce , yue dongye and his second daughter lived in gujiao city . the house that ent_0 rents is very close to his mother and often goes to his mother 's house to eat mixed meals . and ent_1 , after moving away from the neighbor 's house , first borrowed the house of another villager , and after that , the house collapsed , and he began a journey to feed his single while working , and was approaching this house . the farther away . he and his son have lived in a bad family 's house . in the eyes of his ex - wife and two daughters , ent_1 is not a diligent person . yue dongye even described the ex - husband as " loose and leisurely , " " the money he earns ca n't support himself , and a little money is spent on eating and smoking . " actually , ent_1 did n't make much money . ent_1 , who is working outside , is to show people the door , or help others to raise livestock such as pigs and sheep . during this time , he also suffered from cerebral infarction and was hospitalized three times . chen runxiao , the former village party secretary of the village of chenjiashe where ent_1 is located , told the china business daily that in 2007 , when he was the village party secretary , ent_1 was given a " minimum living allowance " considering that he had a cerebral infarction and no housing . " dibao " has been received since 2008 . after chen runxiao ceased to serve as the village party secretary in 2009 , he did not know whether ent_1 was still enjoying the " minimum security " treatment . when a reporter from the china business daily interviewed in gujiao city , most of the interviewees believed that the reason for ent_1 's suicide was that his " minimum living allowance " was inexplicably cancelled three years ago . from the perspective of his ex - wife yue dongye , the minimum guarantee of more than 1,000 yuan per year is life - saving money for ent_1 . ent_1 also went to live with his son , but his son 's life is not much better . shortly after marriage , ent_0 started selling fruit on the floor . later , after giving birth to a son and a daughter , a family of 4 rented in a private house of less than 20 square meters in the north of gujiao city . a reporter from the china business daily saw in a private house that two beds , one large and one small , occupied nearly a third of the space in the house . the two electrical appliances at home were the tv set and the washing machine . the landlord told the visiting reporter that the monthly rent for this room is only more than 100 yuan , but even so , the family has owed rent for nearly a year . occasionally , ent_1 went to help his son to look after the fruit stand.many people who are familiar with the father and son signed the certificate . in 2013 , ent_0 rented a house to live with his father , but a few months later , ent_1 went to help his cousin again , so he did not live with his son . in march and april of this year , uncle yuebuwang saw at ent_0 's fruit stand that ent_0 was giving his father pocket money . at that time , yue buwang was angry and scolded his former brother - in - law , " it 's not easy for a child to support the family and live a life . you are so kind to ask him for money " ? ent_1 left silently . no one knows where he lives . yue buwang felt that ent_1 should live in a part - time job . if there is really no place to live , go to the guest house , you can live for more than ten dollars a day . although in the eyes of his family , ent_1 is not diligent , even a little idle . however , in chen runxiao 's view , the facts may not be all this way . " after getting a cerebral infarction , people will not be able to work , and people will be weak . " cancellation of dibao ? was it abandoned ? questions to be resolved so , has ent_1 's dibao been cancelled ? on november 4th , a reporter from the china business daily interviewed the ent_2 and the xingjiashe township government , all of which were based on the consent of the propaganda department . and refused . but before this , ent_3 , secretary of the xingjiashe township party committee in gujiao city , admitted in an interview with the media that ent_1 did not have a home or live in a house . earlier , ent_1 's " minimum security " was cancelled , because ent_1 's work abroad can earn an income of seven or eight thousand yuan per year . regarding ent_0 's refusal to obtain bail pending trial , ent_3 once told the local media that the government helped him apply for bail pending trial , but only if ent_0 could no longer petition and demand financial compensation for his father 's death .

when the hot weather arrives , it is indispensable for the umbrella to attach a sunshade film to the car . it is the choice of many drivers to block ultraviolet rays and protect privacy . however , the window film is not casually attached if you want to paste it .  traffic police reminder : van window glass sunshade film if the light transmittance does not meet the national standards , it will not pass the vehicle inspection . at the same time , the traffic police department called on the majority of van owners to try not to paste the sunshade film , so as not to affect the driver 's sight . according to national standards such as " safety technical conditions for motor vehicle operation " ( gb7258 ) , all window glass of vans can not be pasted with mirror reflective sunshade film , opaque or colored paper and heat insulation paper with mirror reflective material , side windows and rear windshield glass the light transmittance should reach 50 % ; the light transmittance of the front windshield glass and the side window portion used by the driver to observe the exterior rearview mirror should reach 70 % . why is there such a requirement ? what is the effect of sticking the window film ?  the effect of sticking the window film 1 affects the field of view the light transmittance of the windshield of the vehicle will seriously affect driving safety , especially in bad weather or driving at night . if the car film is not properly attached , it will affect driving vision and eye fatigue , which may induce traffic accidents . in addition to affecting the field of vision of the vehicle itself , inferior car films may also interfere with the sight of other drivers . the front and rear windshields whose light transmittance can meet the requirements of the regulations can allow the rear car to see other pedestrians or vehicles through the front car , so as to quickly make corresponding predictions and measures in advance . but after the big black film was attached , the line of sight was blocked , so it was impossible to make a prejudgement , and it was more likely to cause an accident . 2 pollution in the car the source of odor in the car is complex , but the impact of the car film can not be underestimated . the material of many inferior films is not environmentally friendly , resulting in odor in the car using the inferior film . it is important to know that a large area of the car film is attached to the car , and it is exposed to direct sunlight in summer . the high temperature will further distribute harmful substances and endanger the health of the people in the car . 3 potential safety hazards found in the past van inspection and road duty , the owner attached dark sunshade film to the side windows and rear windshield glass of the van to cover vehicle modification , over - capacity transportation , illegal cargo , mixed passenger and cargo transportation , and illegal transportation violations of dangerous goods and other illegal situations can be seen from time to time , increasing the difficulty of pavement management , which is not conducive to the timely detection and investigation of illegal behaviors , and potentially greater safety hazards . before the " guangdong traffic police " released a related case , there are many lucky drivers who gave the van a black window film to do illegal things , avoid inspections and avoid punishment ! in the van with the black window film attached , the driver ignored the life and loaded 25 young children into the car , which was overloaded by 200 % ; some even installed a gas tank , and the van driver also loaded a car with explosives ! there are many hazards of black car film . the guangdong police decided to take action  strictly check the light transmittance of the window glass sunshade film of the van . according to the unified deployment of the traffic management bureau of the provincial public security department , from now on , the traffic police departments around guangdong will use the transmittance meter to strictly inspect the van the transmittance of the window glass shading film . for those who leave the factory after january 1 , 2018 , and do not meet the requirements of the standard , they will be included in the illegal motor vehicle products , and they will not be registered ; for vehicles that are pasted with colored or dark shading films , and the light transmittance does not meet the national standards , no pass the inspection and inspection ; in the process of road enforcement , if the light transmittance of the window glass shading film does not meet the national standards , it will be punished according to the technical standards of the parts , and at the same time urge the owner to make timely corrections . how to self - examine ? under normal circumstances , for those who can not clearly observe the interior of the car through the side windows and rear windshield glass , or if the side windows and rear windshield glass are pasted with colored or dark shade films , it can be preliminarily determined that the light transmittance can not meet 50 % standard requirement . it should be noted that china does not prohibit the use of window glass shading films , but only requires the light transmittance after the shading film is posted . the requirements for vans are also applicable to the specific requirements of all cars . let 's review all window glass . sunshade film ; the light transmittance of the front windshield glass and the side window portion used by the driver to observe the exterior rearview mirror should reach 70 % ; all window glass should not be pasted with opaque and colored paper with mirror reflection material and heat insulation the light transmittance of paper , side windows and rear windshield glass should reach 50 % . owners , please pay attention to whether your car has unqualified window film source : guangdong traffic police editor : ent_0

court : the only cause of the consequences of the case of mo huanjing 's fire - fighting case is firefighting and rescue compliance . publicly sentenced the defendant mo huanjing in the first instance of hangzhou intermediate people 's court to set fire and theft ( appeal ) , ruling to dismiss the appeal and uphold the original sentence ; mo huanjing 's death sentence was reported to the supreme people 's court for approval in accordance with the law . mo huanjing and his defenders and prosecutors attended the sentencing . ent_0s ' relatives , deputies to the national people 's ent_1 , members of the ent_2 , media reporters , and representatives from all walks of life participated in the audit . the presiding judge read out the criminal ruling of the second instance in this case . the criminal ruling shows that the case was verified by the second trial of the zhejiang provincial higher people 's court . the facts of the first trial that mo huanjing set fire to and theft were clear , and the evidence was true and sufficient . regarding the grounds of appeal and the prosecution opinions , the judgment and analysis of the zhejiang higher people 's court are as follows : ( 5 ) whether there is a causal relationship between the public security fire rescue and the serious consequences of this case . if an action that endangers society will inevitably lead to an endangering result , only when the intervention of external forces aggravates or promotes the occurrence of such an outcome can it be considered as multiple causes and effects in criminal law . the evidence in the case shows that this case does not exist in this case , mo huanjing 's arson act is the only reason for the consequences of this case . it is a statutory duty for the public security fire department to block or reduce fire losses by the fire rescue department . if you do not do your due diligence , you should bear the responsibility . however , from this case , the existing evidence can not confirm this . according to the evidence in the case , the 119 command center and 110 command center of the public security organ have received alarms from the ent_0 ent_3 and related masses from 5:04 on june 22 , 2017 . hangzhou public security fire bureau immediately dispatched firefighters and fire trucks to the scene at 5:07 , and arrived at the main entrance on the north side of the incident area at 5:11 . under the guidance of the community security , the iron gate was demolished and ran into the bottom of the burning building . at 5:16 , the fire fighting and rescue equipment was brought into the building . at 5:30 , it was found that the range of the water gun dropped from 10 meters to less than 2 meters , which could not meet the needs of fire fighting . the fire gradually increased from 5:36 . the fireman immediately notified the property to check the operation of the fire pump , and at 5:40 the remote start button of the indoor fire hydrant was pressed , but the fire hydrant pump was not started in time . after the hydrant pump was started at 5:45 , the water pressure still could not meet the needs of fire fighting . the fire commander found that the valve of the fire hydrant pump adapter in the community was rusted . on the one hand , he contacted the water supply department to pressurize the municipal water supply network near the incident . on the other hand , he promptly ordered the firefighters to lay the hose along the stairs and at 6:15 complete the laying of hoses to achieve the water supply of the hoses and gradually control the fire . the fire was basically extinguished around 6:48 , 4 ent_0s were found by search and rescue and handed over to medical staff . the evidence in the case proves that after the internal firefighter entered the scene of the fire , the firefighting and personnel search and rescue work were carried out simultaneously . in the absence of conditions for direct rescue , firefighters must take effective control of the fire as the premise , and then create conditions for rescue . based on the fire site environment and house structure of this case , there is no firefighter who saves first and then extinguishes fire . objective factor . before the trapped persons were found by the search and rescue , the relevant firefighters and property staff members answered negatively to the question of the relatives of the ent_0s and the people at the scene about whether the trapped persons were searched and rescued , and the four ent_0s were not found until the end of the fire rescue . the facts are not contradictory . the four ent_0s were not discovered until the end of the fire fighting , which is directly related to the trapped location of the four ent_0s far away from the entrance door and the fire on the scene . looking at the fire fighting process in this case , the firefighters performed their legal duties , and the rescue was in compliance with the regulations . there was no dereliction of duty , mistake , or delay . the extended fire rescue time is due to objective reasons such as insufficient water pressure and rusty valve of the pump adapter . in addition , the evidence in the case also proved that the ent_0 ent_3 called 110 or 119 three times at 5:04:35 , 5:05:55 and 5:08:52 on the same day . the call recording showed that ent_3 last called the time was 5:11:48 . at that time , it was very difficult to speak and breathe . during the call , i could not answer the 120 dispatcher 's inquiries . during the call , i did not hear the voice of the child . all three children were in a coma at 5:12 . at the same time , the fire experts at the first trial explained that the carbon monoxide concentration of smoke in the fire site can generally reach 4 % 6 to 8 minutes after the fire , and the carbon monoxide concentration of 1 % can cause poisoning and death . if the trapped personnel in the fire site can not reach 6 to 7 evacuation within minutes means that life is in danger . the four ent_0s in this case hid in the north bedroom to avoid danger after the fire , and the north bedroom only had a narrow floor - to - ceiling glass window that could be pushed outwards for more than ten centimeters , and the smoke exhaust ventilation effect was limited . therefore , when the firefighters first attacked the fire , the possibility of the four ent_0s ' survival was very slim . this situation is consistent with the conclusion that the four ent_0s of the public security organ 's forensic corpse inspection and identification opinions died of carbon monoxide poisoning in the fire . from the analysis of the time of death of the four ent_0s , the death of the four ent_0s is a direct result of mo huanjing 's deliberate arson . in the circumstances at that time , fire rescue was unable to stop the death . therefore , the defender 's suggestion that there is a causal relationship between fire rescue and the consequences of this case , that there is a multi - cause and one - effect situation in this case , and that mo huanjing should obtain the penalty benefit of mitigating criminal liability and punishment can not be established and is not accepted . mo huanjing pointed out that the public security fire department did not fully reflect the basic principle of " priority guarantee of the safety of the lives of people in distress " during the rescue , which was inconsistent with the facts found and could not be established or accepted . background the hangzhou nanny 's arson case was sentenced to the second instance , and the original sentence was upheld . mo huanjing was sentenced to death . at 15:00 on june 4 , 2018 , the zhejiang provincial high people 's court publicly sentenced the defendant mo huanjing in the first instance of the hangzhou intermediate people 's court in the second court of this court . in the case of arson and theft ( appeal ) , the ruling dismissed the appeal and upheld the original sentence ; mo huanjing 's death sentence was reported to the supreme people 's court for approval in accordance with the law . mo huanjing and his defenders and prosecutors attended the sentencing . recalling the ninth arson case , the second instance upheld the original court : mo huanjing surrendered himself and refused to believe that mo huanjing continued to remind the police of his unusual behavior and behavior before the case and carried out ideological education before questioning him . the main criminal fact of the act . therefore , the defender pointed out that mo huanjing 's suggestion that he voluntarily surrendered himself before the public security organs had grasped the main facts of the arson crime , and that the public security organs inspected mo huanjing 's mobile phone violation of the law could not be established.(editor in charge : ji xueying _ nn6784 ) load the full text one - click installation of the official client , timely push of major events read more

court : the only cause of the consequences of the case of mo huanjing 's fire - fighting case is firefighting and rescue compliance . publicly sentenced the defendant mo huanjing in the first instance of hangzhou intermediate people 's court to set fire and theft ( appeal ) , ruling to dismiss the appeal and uphold the original sentence ; mo huanjing 's death sentence was reported to the supreme people 's court for approval in accordance with the law . mo huanjing and his defenders and prosecutors attended the sentencing . ent_0s ' relatives , deputies to the national people 's ent_1 , members of the ent_2 , media reporters , and representatives from all walks of life participated in the audit . the presiding judge read out the criminal ruling of the second instance in this case . the criminal ruling shows that the case was verified by the second trial of the zhejiang provincial higher people 's court . the facts of the first trial that mo huanjing set fire to and theft were clear , and the evidence was true and sufficient . regarding the grounds of appeal and the prosecution opinions , the judgment and analysis of the zhejiang higher people 's court are as follows : ( 5 ) whether there is a causal relationship between the public security fire rescue and the serious consequences of this case . if an action that endangers society will inevitably lead to an endangering result , only when the intervention of external forces aggravates or promotes the occurrence of such an outcome can it be considered as multiple causes and effects in criminal law . the evidence in the case shows that this case does not exist in this case , mo huanjing 's arson act is the only reason for the consequences of this case . it is a statutory duty for the public security fire department to block or reduce fire losses by the fire rescue department . if you do not do your due diligence , you should bear the responsibility . however , from this case , the existing evidence can not confirm this . according to the evidence in the case , the 119 command center and 110 command center of the public security organ have received alarms from the ent_0 ent_3 and related masses from 5:04 on june 22 , 2017 . hangzhou public security fire bureau immediately dispatched firefighters and fire trucks to the scene at 5:07 , and arrived at the main entrance on the north side of the incident area at 5:11 . under the guidance of the community security , the iron gate was demolished and ran into the bottom of the burning building . at 5:16 , the fire fighting and rescue equipment was brought into the building . at 5:30 , it was found that the range of the water gun dropped from 10 meters to less than 2 meters , which could not meet the needs of fire fighting . the fire gradually increased from 5:36 . the fireman immediately notified the property to check the operation of the fire pump , and at 5:40 the remote start button of the indoor fire hydrant was pressed , but the fire hydrant pump was not started in time . after the hydrant pump was started at 5:45 , the water pressure still could not meet the needs of fire fighting . the fire commander found that the valve of the fire hydrant pump adapter in the community was rusted . on the one hand , he contacted the water supply department to pressurize the municipal water supply network near the incident . on the other hand , he promptly ordered the firefighters to lay the hose along the stairs and at 6:15 complete the laying of hoses to achieve the water supply of the hoses and gradually control the fire . the fire was basically extinguished around 6:48 , 4 ent_0s were found by search and rescue and handed over to medical staff . the evidence in the case proves that after the internal firefighter entered the scene of the fire , the firefighting and personnel search and rescue work were carried out simultaneously . in the absence of conditions for direct rescue , firefighters must take effective control of the fire as the premise , and then create conditions for rescue . based on the fire site environment and house structure of this case , there is no firefighter who saves first and then extinguishes fire . objective factor . before the trapped persons were found by the search and rescue , the relevant firefighters and property staff members answered negatively to the question of the relatives of the ent_0s and the people at the scene about whether the trapped persons were searched and rescued , and the four ent_0s were not found until the end of the fire rescue . the facts are not contradictory . the four ent_0s were not discovered until the end of the fire fighting , which is directly related to the trapped location of the four ent_0s far away from the entrance door and the fire on the scene . looking at the fire fighting process in this case , the firefighters performed their legal duties , and the rescue was in compliance with the regulations . there was no dereliction of duty , mistake , or delay . the extended fire rescue time is due to objective reasons such as insufficient water pressure and rusty valve of the pump adapter . in addition , the evidence in the case also proved that the ent_0 ent_3 called 110 or 119 three times at 5:04:35 , 5:05:55 and 5:08:52 on the same day . the call recording showed that ent_3 last called the time was 5:11:48 . at that time , it was very difficult to speak and breathe . during the call , i could not answer the 120 dispatcher 's inquiries . during the call , i did not hear the voice of the child . all three children were in a coma at 5:12 . at the same time , the fire experts at the first trial explained that the carbon monoxide concentration of smoke in the fire site can generally reach 4 % 6 to 8 minutes after the fire , and the carbon monoxide concentration of 1 % can cause poisoning and death . if the trapped personnel in the fire site can not reach 6 to 7 evacuation within minutes means that life is in danger . the four ent_0s in this case hid in the north bedroom to avoid danger after the fire , and the north bedroom only had a narrow floor - to - ceiling glass window that could be pushed outwards for more than ten centimeters , and the smoke exhaust ventilation effect was limited . therefore , when the firefighters first attacked the fire , the possibility of the four ent_0s ' survival was very slim . this situation is consistent with the conclusion that the four ent_0s of the public security organ 's forensic corpse inspection and identification opinions died of carbon monoxide poisoning in the fire . from the analysis of the time of death of the four ent_0s , the death of the four ent_0s is a direct result of mo huanjing 's deliberate arson . in the circumstances at that time , fire rescue was unable to stop the death . therefore , the defender 's suggestion that there is a causal relationship between fire rescue and the consequences of this case , that there is a multi - cause and one - effect situation in this case , and that mo huanjing should obtain the penalty benefit of mitigating criminal liability and punishment can not be established and is not accepted . mo huanjing pointed out that the public security fire department did not fully reflect the basic principle of " priority guarantee of the safety of the lives of people in distress " during the rescue , which was inconsistent with the facts found and could not be established or accepted . background the hangzhou nanny 's arson case was sentenced to the second instance ,

the midstream may use this information to steal property or directly resell it for profit ; the downstream will monetize the obtained data in the form of theft and fraud . in cases of infringement of property rights involved in cybercrime , although the amount of fraud against the unspecified public is small , it has a wide range of influence and a large number of victims , so the overall amount of crime is large . for example , in the case of guo moumou 's telecommunications fraud , the perpetrators pretended to be prosecutors and police officers and defrauded the victim of more than rmb 18 million ( rmb , the same below ) on the grounds that the victim was suspected of a criminal offense . in the case of ou moumou 's illegal absorption of public deposits , the perpetrators promoted their wealth management products in the form of wechat public accounts and absorbed more than 50 million yuan in deposits from more than 100 people . the current transnational trend of cybercrime is increasing . criminals often defraud domestic victims abroad or rent servers to attack overseas servers . such acts are commonly seen in telecommunication network fraud cases and traffic hijacking cases . at the same time , with the popularization of internet technology , the combination of traditional crime and network platforms and technologies has begun to extend and expand the traditional crimes such as gambling , drug trafficking , and pornography into the network society , resulting in online gambling , online pornography , and drug trafficking , internet financial fraud and other crimes . in order to cope with the challenges of industrialization and complexity of cybercrime , the people 's procuratorate of haidian district in beijing continues to innovate a professional case handling mechanism , establish an " outside brain " expert database , and actively carry out expert consultation to greatly improve the efficiency of handling cases ; introduce technicians as judicial assistants , act as prosecutors ' " left and right brains " , and intervene in case handling with the case handling team ; actively hold discussions with industry associations such as the internet association and key enterprises to discuss issues such as combating internet crime . author : yin li

" hainan yedao said . after the coconut island deer tortoise wine fell into the " viagra door " , its share price did not seem too optimistic . on august 3 , the stock price of yedao deer turtle wine was hit to a limit . the financial report for the first quarter of this year showed that hainan coconut island 's net profit and non - net profit deduction were 715,400 yuan and -449,63 million , respectively , a significant decrease of 93.79 % and 330.64 % year - on - year . on august 29 , a notice gave dawn to the coconut island deer tortoise wine in the predicament . the hainan provincial food and drug administration issued a notice to hainan yedao to confirm that the " yedao deer tortoise wine " does not contain illegal additives can continue normal production and shelf sales . what is the current production situation of yedao deer turtle wine ? after the " viagra door " , how do companies control and adjust the addition of health wine ingredients ? in early september , a reporter from the yangtze river commercial daily called the hainan yedao secretariat several times , but the call remained unanswered . then , the reporter left a message on its official website , but did not get a reply as of press time . subsequently , the reporter visited many supermarkets and hotels in wuhan and chengdu , and found that there are very few sales points of yedao deer turtle wine in the two places . there are basically no batches of 100ml deer turtle wine sold . carrefour and wal - mart in wuhan the sales staff told reporters : " the coconut island deer turtle wine has not been sold in the past two years . " some companies take risks in order to achieve quick results " the health care wine industry is not as prosperous as it was in the 1990s . " boss zhang of the nanhu hotel in wuhan city laments to reporters . as a unique health food , health wine has a wide market in china . insiders pointed out that the current health wine market size is about 13 billion yuan , known as the fourth largest market in the domestic wine industry . but now the sales of the gift market are declining . in order to promote sales , consumers need to quickly experience the effects of the product , so some companies may take risks and illegally add prohibited substances . " some companies will add some drugs or chemical ingredients in violation of the regulations in order to achieve the effect of publicity , so that the efficacy of the product will quickly show up , causing consumers an illusion that this product can achieve the effect after drinking it once or twice . , in order to seize market share . " the above - mentioned people in the health wine industry who did not want to be named told reporters . the combination of wine and medicine is a great progress in drinking and keeping in good health . the combination of wine and medicine has produced a brand - new wine - health wine . the main feature of health wine is the addition of medicinal materials in the brewing process , mainly to maintain health and body , and has the effect of health care . its medication is stressful and compatible . according to its function , it can be divided into qi , blood , yin , yang and qi blood double tonic and other types . public information shows that the effective ingredients determine the efficacy , and doctors are very careful about prescribing " viagra " . however , in the view of the above - mentioned industry insiders , some health wine companies only want to add illegally and will not take into account the consequences . although " viagra " brings gospel to some patients , the us food and drug administration warned that doctors should be cautious when prescribing " viagra " to certain men , as there are various side effects . this side effect is manifested as headache , dazzling , masking cardiovascular disease , reduced blood pressure , glaucoma , temporary deafness and so on . " whether it is health food or ordinary food , western medicine ingredients can not be added to it . " ent_1 , deputy secretary general of china health care association , believes that adding western medicine ingredients to food is illegal , and due to problems such as inaccurate dosage , it is likely to cause serious problems such as tachycardia . due to the slow effectiveness of traditional chinese medicine ingredients , the current problem of adding western medicines to health foods is more common , disrupting the health food market . new wines created under the banner of health care are added illegally in the production process . what is the purpose ? " this can reduce the production cost of enterprises for health wine . " industry insiders revealed to reporters , " the situation that health wine is added with chemical substances such as sildenafil has actually become an unspoken rule for the survival of some companies in the industry . basically , 1 gram of sildenafil can make more than 1 pound of health wine , and the price of sildenafil is only a few cents for 1 gram , which greatly reduces the cost for enterprises . " the chemical manufacturer of dinafil once calculated an account for the media . the price of 1 gram of sildenafil is about 0.8 yuan . if you buy more , you can also reduce the price . this raw material is 100 % soluble wine and added to the wine according to the amount used . generally , 80 - 120 mg is added to 100 grams ( 2 taels ) of wine , which means that 8 yuan of sildenafil can be added to the health wine of about 10 pounds , and the cost is negligible . lack of industry standard system enterprise supervision is difficult in fact , this is not the first exposure of the illegal addition of health wine . due to various reasons , in recent years , there have been frequent events in the health wine industry that seriously affect the interests of consumers . the reporter combed and found that there are three main types of events that affect consumer interests : one is that black - hearted merchants manufacture and sell fake and inferior health wine products ; the second is to add harmful drugs to health wine ; the third is to exaggerate or even falsely promote the function of health wine to mislead consumption by . in the " under investigation " list , sanjiu enterprise group was also involved . the cordyceps militaris wine produced by sanjiu enterprise group lankao dijiu wine industry co. , ltd . was accused of adding sildenafil . on june 2 this year , the liuzhou food and drug administration of guangxi made a surprise inspection and found that the " gold pot kung fu wine " produced by a local winery contains sildenafil and other chemical substances that are prohibited from being added to food.subsequently , on june 13 and july 23 , law enforcement officers investigated and dealt with liuzhou high - tech zone lvshen biological co. , ltd . and another liuzhou deshun winery producing " liuba god health wine " according to law . . after sampling inspection , the three wines seized contained illegally added chemicals such as sildenafil and tadalafil . at present , the heads of the two companies have been arrested by the police . fan guicheng , the team leader of liuzhou food and drug inspection detachment , once explained the results of the inspection . the content of sildenafil in different batches of " golden pot kung fu wine " is not the same , with the highest content exceeding 1000 mg . this wine is packaged in small bottles of 125 ml each , which is equivalent to more than 120 mg of sildenafil in a bottle of wine . the " viagra " produced by pfizer in the united states usually contains 50 mg of sildenafil . " that is to say , a bottle of kung fu wine is equivalent to two " viagra " . " why do health wines repeatedly have problems ? the yangtze river commercial daily reporter interviewed many people in the health wine industry that china currently does not have a set of testing standards for the health wine industry , and there are loopholes in supervision , which has caused some health wine manufacturers to illegally produce without fear . " health wine as a wine industry , but does not have a set of own regulatory guidelines . at present , china 's health wine industry is planned in the field of health products industry . however , china has not yet a precise unified definition , plus the low entry barrier to entry and the unclear technical specifications and standards make it difficult for all health wine manufacturers to unify the addition of drugs . " the above - mentioned industry sources said . in view of the mixed fish and dragon situation in the health wine industry , the state administration of the people 's republic of china recently issued the " notice on strict investigation and handling of the illegal addition of health wines and blended wines to strengthen the supervision of the quality and safety of wine products " . achieve full coverage of health wine production and operation enterprises , and thoroughly investigate the source of production of illegal products and the source of illegally added sildenafil and other chemical substances . however , due to the low entry barrier and lack of industry standards , the health wine industry is in chaos . industry insiders told reporters : " now there are many small companies in the health wine industry , and the private sales of hotels and vendors are also common , which greatly exacerbates the difficulty of supervision . " because of the strong consumer demand for health in recent years , health wine sales increased against the market . all forces have deployed the health wine market . liquor companies such as fenjiu group , maotai distillery , ent_2 , ent_3 , etc . have successively deployed the health wine market . pharmaceutical companies are also optimistic about the health wine market . many well - known pharmaceutical companies , including ent_4 , have also begun to test health wine . even the ent_5 , which is a real estate developer , is involved in health wine . this has also accelerated the " dividing " of the health wine industry . market structure . in this regard , industry insiders suggest that the supervision of health wine should keep pace with the development of new formats and crack down on the illegal addition of chemical drugs from the source . it is necessary to ensure that the sales channels are legal and standardized , and that the apis sold can be tracked . it is illegal to add western medicine ingredients to food . at the same time , due to the problem of inaccurate dosage , it may cause serious problems such as tachycardia . due to the slow effectiveness of traditional chinese medicine ingredients , the current problem of adding western medicines to health foods is more common , disrupting the health food market .   ent_1 , deputy secretary general of china health care association

in the early morning of july 6 , 2017 , the police of minhang branch of shanghai public security bureau received a report from sun that in the underground parking lot of a supermarket in minhang district , his wife ms . zhang took her two - year - old child in her private car threatened by a masked man with a knife , he was robbed of more than 5,000 yuan in cash ; on june 7 , a female driver was robbed by a man with a knife in the parking lot of vientiane city , nanning city , guangxi zhuang autonomous region . when going to the parking lot , he was caught by the security guard of the shopping mall ... in recent years , security incidents have occurred in large - scale office buildings , shopping malls , supermarkets , and underground parking lots in residential areas from time to time . when did such a security incident happen ? how to prevent it ? a reporter from legal daily conducted an in - depth investigation into this . encountered an " unexpected " in a place that was once thought to be safe . this is a summary of her own experience half a year ago by ent_0 , a single woman working in chongqing . one night , ent_0 drove back to his place of residence in ent_1 , chongqing . after parking the car in the underground parking lot of the community , ent_0 noticed that someone had been staring at him . ent_0 , who found something wrong , immediately got in the car and locked the door , and began to call the 24-hour on - duty property management . " the other party saw me outside for a while before leaving . " ent_0 recalled , " at that time , i kept dialing the property duty number , but no one answered it . i did n't call 110 because i was worried about a misjudgment . report to the police . later , i asked the community property to monitor the video and found that more than a dozen of the underground parking lots were bad and could not be retrieved . " " legal daily " reporter investigation found that ent_0 's experience was not alone example . there are a lot of hidden dangers in public security in some shopping malls , supermarkets and residential areas in beijing , the reporters of the " legal daily " found some " common problems " : dim light in underground parking lots , blind spots in monitoring probes , and mobile phone signals affected , gps navigation system can not receive the signal , etc . on july 29 , a reporter from the legal daily came to the underground car park of carrefour supermarket in caoqiao area of beijing . there is an entrance directly to the supermarket , and many cameras " watch " the vehicles and personnel . however , the reporter made a circle in the underground parking lot and did not see the property management staff . after entering the underground parking lot , the reporter 's mobile phone signal was obviously weakened , especially when it was away from the supermarket entrance , the mobile phone showed no signal . " the underground parking lot is so dark and the signal is poor . if there is a robbery , the police will be too late . " said a woman who picked up the car . on the afternoon of july 30 , a reporter from the legal daily came to the youtang shopping center in chaoyang district , beijing , where various businesses gathered , but the environment of its underground parking lot is not optimistic - next to the down channel there are many vehicles parked , and the lights of the entire down channel are weak , and the vehicles enter the underground parking lot as if crossing a " black hole " . at the entrance of the parking lot on the negative fourth floor , only two or three people were on duty . in this parking area that accommodates two or three hundred motor vehicles , the reporter did not find that the property management staff patrolled and the cell phone signal was relatively poor . at around 10:30 on july 31 , a reporter from the legal daily came to the underground parking lot of yidigang in chaoyang district , beijing . the underground parking lot is divided into two floors , and each floor is visually as large as two football fields . the lights in the two - storey car park are dim , but traffic signs and safety exit signs are relatively complete . convex reflectors are installed at the sharp bends of the intersections . the lanes and sidewalks are distinguished by different colors . the ground and walls have clear pointing signs . surveillance cameras are installed in different directions . even so , a number of customers told the " legal daily " reporter that the intersection in the underground parking lot is complicated , like a maze , and it is easy to get lost . in the yidigang underground parking lot , a reporter from the " legal daily " asked the toll booth staff to learn that the underground parking lot has 3 exits , and there are security personnel on foot in the parking lot to patrol regularly , and the security director drives the patrol car patrol . the reporter questioned that no patrol was seen in the parking lot . the staff stated that the parking lot was very large and the patrol on foot took a long time , so the patrol staff might not be seen . then , a reporter from legal daily came to the underground parking lot of jingdu international community near yidi port . the parking lot was right next to the community gate . the reporter walked into the underground parking lot , and the security guard at the gate of the community did not interrogate or block it . after entering the underground parking lot of the community , the reporter found that the light in the parking lot was dim and there were only a few fluorescent lamps overhead . there is no convex reflector at the corner of the entrance of the underground parking lot , and the driver 's sight is easily obstructed . the reporter walked along the road to the bottom of the slope and found that a police box on the left was lit with a small electric fan and a water cup , but no one was on duty . the reporter continued to follow the direction of the exit indicated by the road signs and walked to the exit without seeing the surveillance camera . in the meantime , the reporter 's cell phone had no signal . the exit of the parking lot has only the automatic license plate recognition system and is unattended . the parking lot exit is next to the other gate of the community . the reporter asked the security guard at the door whether the parking lot was managed by him . the security guard denied that the underground parking lot was managed by the community property . asked where the manager was , the security guard said he did n't know . the reporter then walked in from the exit of the parking lot again , and the security guards did not stop . when i came to the post inside the parking lot i found again , there was still no managerial staff in the post . fire hazards are large in addition to security risks , underground parking lots are also high - fire areas . at 22:15 on july 27 , the zhenhai fire department of ningbo city , zhejiang province received the police , and the underground parking lot in the high - rise residential area of jinxiu jiangnan , zhenhai , caught fire ; the morning of june 8 , hangzhou city , zhejiang province lu qingyi garden 's underground parking lot caught fire ; in the afternoon of february 22 , the underground parking lot of no . 3 building of hexinyuan community near the intersection of yueyang road and xi'an road in heping district , tianjin suddenly burst into smoke . many fire trucks did not put out the fire until they arrived at the scene ... according to ent_2 of beijing urban construction design and development group co. , ltd . , the large underground parking lot has a small exhaust hole area and low heat dissipation performance , so a fire occurs . at that time , the heat dissipation is slow , the internal temperature of the underground parking lot rises faster , and the indoor air volume increases faster , resulting in increased indoor pressure , plus the large underground parking space of large commercial buildings , up and down , left and right connected together , the interior decoration of the car is mostly made of polyurethane synthetic materials , which is easy to burn . once a fire occurs , the fire will spread quickly , causing serious fire accidents . in addition , the underground parking lot of large underground commercial buildings is prone to " flashover " . when the fire spreads further , the indoor air composition will also change , and the indoor temperature will continue to rise , resulting in greater indoor pressure , resulting in greater indoor pressure . the original wind direction of the air flow changes , and the pressure of the wind flow continues to increase . after some of the wind pressure reaches the exit , it will return to the room with the fresh air at the entrance and flow in the opposite direction , thereby expanding the fire and causing greater fire hazard . " large underground commercial buildings have more internal functions , and the design form of internal buildings is also more complicated , and the design of their underground parking lots is relatively complicated , which is easy to cause people to have emergency situations in underground parking lots . people look for the direction of safe exits . " ent_2 said , especially the design passages and exits of underground parking lots in some commercial squares are one - way , and there is no clear sign for consumer safety exits . another serious problem is that the safe evacuation passages or exits in underground garages of large underground commercial buildings are not spacious enough , which will affect the evacuation of vehicles . " legal daily " reporter found in the investigation that it is not uncommon for parking spaces to occupy safe passages and cars to block safety doors in underground parking lots with high staff density such as supermarkets or underground parking lots in residential areas with tight parking spaces . in a residential area of shuangyushu road , haidian district , beijing , a car owner parked a motor vehicle on the evacuation passage of an underground parking lot.pedestrians have to stand sideways , and it would be more inconvenient to carry big bags if you are not careful , you will hit the door or rearview mirror . in the underground parking lot of mingdujiayuan community , fengtai district , beijing , there are few parking spaces on file , but there are actually multiple parking spaces , some of which are located before the safe exit , and there are potential safety hazards . disputes are difficult to handle zhao jiaxin , from dalian , liaoning province . on may 14 , 2017 , after parking in the underground parking lot of the roosevelt mall on xi'an road in dalian , zhao jiaxin 's vehicle was scratched . at 18:39 that day , zhao jiaxin drove into the underground parking lot attached to the mall and parked his car in the clearly marked parking space . " there are no problems such as crimping , occupying roads , obstructing other vehicles , etc . i just parked in the parking space properly . however , around 20:40 , when i returned to the parking lot , i noticed that the door on the right side of my car had obvious i traced the traces , and i immediately asked the staff to explain the situation . the security guard told me that i could n't get the monitoring and required police authorization . " immediately , zhao jiaxin went to the traffic police detachment for help.after obtaining the authorization from the police , the staff of the underground parking lot called for monitoring , and found that the parking place was monitoring dead spots . " i found that when monitoring the parking lot , there were many dead spots in the underground parking lot , and no vehicles were photographed . the process , but the camera at the entrance of the parking lot clearly showed that my car did not have any scars when entering the park . " zhao jiaxin told the " legal daily " reporter , " in the whole process of the incident , i am still very satisfied with the handling of the traffic police . the traffic police 's reply is , ' if the car collides during driving , it is under the jurisdiction of the traffic police , but the car is parked in the parking lot , and the car damage occurs at a standstill . it is not within the jurisdiction of the traffic police . it should also be the responsibility of the local police station ' " . zhao jiaxin then reported to the police station . " the police at the police station was very timely , and the police stationed twice before and after , but the police at the police station said that this matter is not within their jurisdiction . if i can coordinate with the parking lot best , i can only go to court to prosecute if i ca n't coordinate . hundred yuan went to the court to sue , and the delay could not be afforded . " zhao jiaxin said . in zhao jiaxin 's view , this matter should be the responsibility of the parking lot , " but the person in charge of the shopping mall clearly told me that the shopping mall does not bear any responsibility , the basis of the charge is to provide a parking space , the car is rubbed and need to find the perpetrator and , the mall has been helping me to retrieve surveillance video . according to the attitude of the mall , this thing seems to happen on the road , not in the toll parking lot of the mall . " the final solution is that zhao jiaxin sent the car to the 4s shop and spent 500 yuan for maintenance . " because the amount is not large , it is not worth the insurance . " " legal daily " reporter found in the investigation that after the dispute in the underground parking lot , in the process of handling , the contractual relationship between the owner and the parking lot often became the focus of dispute . in this regard , beijing lawyer ent_3 said in an interview with a reporter from legal daily that the vehicle is parked in an underground parking lot , and the vehicle driver has formed a contractual relationship with the management of the underground parking lot . during the parking period , if the vehicle is damaged due to a third party , the owner or the driver of the vehicle may claim compensation from the underground parking lot management party according to the contract law . after the underground parking lot management party assumes the compensation liability , it may recover the damage from the perpetrator . ent_3 said , however , even if it is handled according to the contract law , there are still differences , namely the dispute between the site lease contract and the custody contract . in 2015 , shanghai no . 1 intermediate people 's court made a judgment in a similar case . in the case heard by the shanghai first intermediate people 's court , the plaintiff 's vehicle was damaged in the defendant 's underground parking lot , which brought a lawsuit . the court held that , based on the evidence and the statements of the parties , it can be determined that the vehicle key is kept by the plaintiff , and the defendant will release the parked vehicle after charging the parking fee based on the parking certificate , and does not review the other conditions of the parked vehicle and the driver . this kind of situation does not meet the control and possession characteristics of the custodian in the storage contract . in addition , according to the actual situation in which the defendant charges a parking fee of 7 yuan per hour , it should not be presumed that the intention of the defendant to enter into the contract includes the willingness to bear the heavier obligation to keep the vehicle . the court finally determined the site lease contract relationship . however , some courts believe that parking the vehicle in the underground parking lot , and the vehicle is completely placed under the management of the underground parking lot , constitutes a delivery , so it is regarded as a storage contract . in the judgment of guangzhou intermediate people 's court of guangzhou city ( 2015 ) sui zhong fa min er zhong zi no . 1545 , the plaintiff 's vehicle was lost in the defendant 's parking lot , resulting in a lawsuit . the plaintiff parked the vehicle in the parking lot operated by the defendant . the vehicle involved in the case was completely under the management of the defendant.there was no situation in which the defendant delivered the parking lot involved to the plaintiff for use and profit . the plaintiff managed the vehicle on his own , and the plaintiff parked it . the behavior of the vehicle paid the defendant the corresponding parking fee , so a paid custody contract relationship was established between the two parties . the determination of the two contract relationships directly determines the proportion of the car park involved in the vehicle accident . under the determination of the site leasing contract relationship , the car park involved generally only bears about 30 % of the responsibility ; under the determination of the custody contract relationship , the car park involved assumes almost full responsibility . ent_3 told the " legal daily " reporter that some people in the industry believe that parking the vehicle in an underground parking lot is a service contract , " contains the provision of temporary venues and security management , and its management and protection obligations are lower than general storage . the contract is similar to the parking space rented in the community . the user pays two fees , one is the rental fee for the parking space owner , and the other is the parking space property management fee for the property management . the commercial parking fee is similar to the combination of the two . " in this regard , beijing lawyer ent_4 believes that strengthening the security of underground parking is the legal responsibility and obligation of the parking lot management party . " the operating mode of the residential parking lot is the toll parking mode , and the parking lot of the commercial premises adopts the two modes of toll parking or shopping consumption free parking . " ent_4 said that no matter which mode the parking lot is operated in , the public will drive the car into the parking lot . after that , a consumer service contract relationship was established with the parking lot management party . according to relevant laws and regulations , after the conclusion of the consumer service contract , the parking lot management party has the responsibility and obligation to provide a safe parking environment for the car owner , and protect the personal and property safety of the car owner within his own ability . " if someone commits robbery in an underground parking lot , resulting in damage to the personal or property of the consumer , the parking lot management party has faults and has not fulfilled its security responsibilities , the injured person or the victim can demand the management party to bear civil compensation liability " ent_4 said .

" said a woman who picked up the car . on the afternoon of july 30 , a reporter from the legal daily came to the youtang shopping center in chaoyang district , beijing , where various businesses gathered , but the environment of its underground parking lot is not optimistic - next to the down channel there are many vehicles parked , and the lights of the entire down channel are weak , and the vehicles enter the underground parking lot as if crossing a " black hole " . at the entrance of the parking lot on the negative fourth floor , only two or three people were on duty . in this parking area that accommodates two or three hundred motor vehicles , the reporter did not find that the property management staff patrolled and the cell phone signal was relatively poor . at around 10:30 on july 31 , a reporter from the legal daily came to the underground parking lot of yidigang in chaoyang district , beijing . the underground parking lot is divided into two floors , and each floor is visually as large as two football fields . the lights in the two - storey car park are dim , but traffic signs and safety exit signs are relatively complete . convex reflectors are installed at the sharp bends of the intersections . the lanes and sidewalks are distinguished by different colors . the ground and walls have clear pointing signs . surveillance cameras are installed in different directions . even so , a number of customers told the " legal daily " reporter that the intersection in the underground parking lot is complicated , like a maze , and it is easy to get lost . in the yidigang underground parking lot , a reporter from the " legal daily " asked the toll booth staff to learn that the underground parking lot has 3 exits , and there are security personnel on foot in the parking lot to patrol regularly , and the security director drives the patrol car patrol . the reporter questioned that no patrol was seen in the parking lot . the staff stated that the parking lot was very large and the patrol on foot took a long time , so the patrol staff might not be seen . then , a reporter from legal daily came to the underground parking lot of jingdu international community near yidi port . the parking lot was right next to the community gate . the reporter walked into the underground parking lot , and the security guard at the gate of the community did not interrogate or block it . after entering the underground parking lot of the community , the reporter found that the light in the parking lot was dim and there were only a few fluorescent lamps overhead . there is no convex reflector at the corner of the entrance of the underground parking lot , and the driver 's sight is easily obstructed . the reporter walked along the road to the bottom of the slope and found that a police box on the left was lit with a small electric fan and a water cup , but no one was on duty . the reporter continued to follow the direction of the exit indicated by the road signs and walked to the exit without seeing the surveillance camera . in the meantime , the reporter 's cell phone had no signal . the exit of the parking lot has only the automatic license plate recognition system and is unattended . the parking lot exit is next to the other gate of the community . the reporter asked the security guard at the door whether the parking lot was managed by him . the security guard denied that the underground parking lot was managed by the community property . asked where the manager was , the security guard said he did n't know . the reporter then walked in from the exit of the parking lot again , and the security guards did not stop . when i came to the post inside the parking lot i found again , there was still no managerial staff in the post . fire hazards are large in addition to security risks , underground parking lots are also high - fire areas . at 22:15 on july 27 , the zhenhai fire department of ningbo city , zhejiang province received the police , and the underground parking lot in the high - rise residential area of jinxiu jiangnan , zhenhai , caught fire ; the morning of june 8 , hangzhou city , zhejiang province lu qingyi garden 's underground parking lot caught fire ; in the afternoon of february 22 , the underground parking lot of no . 3 building of hexinyuan community near the intersection of yueyang road and xi'an road in heping district , tianjin suddenly burst into smoke . many fire trucks did not put out the fire until they arrived at the scene ... according to ent_2 of beijing urban construction design and development group co. , ltd . , the large underground parking lot has a small exhaust hole area and low heat dissipation performance , so a fire occurs . at that time , the heat dissipation is slow , the internal temperature of the underground parking lot rises faster , and the indoor air volume increases faster , resulting in increased indoor pressure , plus the large underground parking space of large commercial buildings , up and down , left and right connected together , the interior decoration of the car is mostly made of polyurethane synthetic materials , which is easy to burn . once a fire occurs , the fire will spread quickly , causing serious fire accidents . in addition , the underground parking lot of large underground commercial buildings is prone to " flashover " . when the fire spreads further , the indoor air composition will also change , and the indoor temperature will continue to rise , resulting in greater indoor pressure , resulting in greater indoor pressure . the original wind direction of the air flow changes , and the pressure of the wind flow continues to increase . after some of the wind pressure reaches the exit , it will return to the room with the fresh air at the entrance and flow in the opposite direction , thereby expanding the fire and causing greater fire hazard . " large underground commercial buildings have more internal functions , and the design form of internal buildings is also more complicated , and the design of their underground parking lots is relatively complicated , which is easy to cause people to have emergency situations in underground parking lots . people look for the direction of safe exits . " ent_2 said , especially the design passages and exits of underground parking lots in some commercial squares are one - way , and there is no clear sign for consumer safety exits . another serious problem is that the safe evacuation passages or exits in underground garages of large underground commercial buildings are not spacious enough , which will affect the evacuation of vehicles . " legal daily " reporter found in the investigation that it is not uncommon for parking spaces to occupy safe passages and cars to block safety doors in underground parking lots with high staff density such as supermarkets or underground parking lots in residential areas with tight parking spaces . in a residential area of shuangyushu road , haidian district , beijing , a car owner parked a motor vehicle on the evacuation passage of an underground parking lot.pedestrians have to stand sideways , and it would be more inconvenient to carry big bags if you are not careful , you will hit the door or rearview mirror . in the underground parking lot of mingdujiayuan community , fengtai district , beijing , there are few parking spaces on file , but there are actually multiple parking spaces , some of which are located before the safe exit , and there are potential safety hazards . disputes are difficult to handle zhao jiaxin , from dalian , liaoning province . on may 14 , 2017 , after parking in the underground parking lot of the roosevelt mall on xi'an road in dalian , zhao jiaxin 's vehicle was scratched . at 18:39 that day , zhao jiaxin drove into the underground parking lot attached to the mall and parked his car in the clearly marked parking space . " there are no problems such as crimping , occupying roads , obstructing other vehicles , etc . i just parked in the parking space properly . however , around 20:40 , when i returned to the parking lot , i noticed that the door on the right side of my car had obvious i traced the traces , and i immediately asked the staff to explain the situation . the security guard told me that i could n't get the monitoring and required police authorization . " immediately , zhao jiaxin went to the traffic police detachment for help.after obtaining the authorization from the police , the staff of the underground parking lot called for monitoring , and found that the parking place was monitoring dead spots . " i found that when monitoring the parking lot , there were many dead spots in the underground parking lot , and no vehicles were photographed . the process , but the camera at the entrance of the parking lot clearly showed that my car did not have any scars when entering the park . " zhao jiaxin told the " legal daily " reporter , " in the whole process of the incident , i am still very satisfied with the handling of the traffic police . the traffic police 's reply is , ' if the car collides during driving , it is under the jurisdiction of the traffic police , but the car is parked in the parking lot , and the car damage occurs at a standstill . it is not within the jurisdiction of the traffic police . it should also be the responsibility of the local police station ' " . zhao jiaxin then reported to the police station . " the police at the police station was very timely , and the police stationed twice before and after , but the police at the police station said that this matter is not within their jurisdiction . if i can coordinate with the parking lot best , i can only go to court to prosecute if i ca n't coordinate . hundred yuan went to the court to sue , and the delay could not be afforded . " zhao jiaxin said . in zhao jiaxin 's view , this matter should be the responsibility of the parking lot , " but the person in charge of the shopping mall clearly told me that the shopping mall does not bear any responsibility , the basis of the charge is to provide a parking space , the car is rubbed and need to find the perpetrator and , the mall has been helping me to retrieve surveillance video . according to the attitude of the mall , this thing seems to happen on the road , not in the toll parking lot of the mall . " the final solution is that zhao jiaxin sent the car to the 4s shop and spent 500 yuan for maintenance . " because the amount is not large , it is not worth the insurance . " " legal daily " reporter found in the investigation that after the dispute in the underground parking lot , in the process of handling , the contractual relationship between the owner and the parking lot often became the focus of dispute . in this regard , beijing lawyer ent_3 said in an interview with a reporter from legal daily that the vehicle is parked in an underground parking lot , and the vehicle driver has formed a contractual relationship with the management of the underground parking lot . during the parking period , if the vehicle is damaged due to a third party , the owner or the driver of the vehicle may claim compensation from the underground parking lot management party according to the contract law . after the underground parking lot management party assumes the compensation liability , it may recover the damage from the perpetrator . ent_3 said , however , even if it is handled according to the contract law , there are still differences , namely the dispute between the site lease contract and the custody contract . in 2015 , shanghai no . 1 intermediate people 's court made a judgment in a similar case . in the case heard by the shanghai first intermediate people 's court , the plaintiff 's vehicle was damaged in the defendant 's underground parking lot , which brought a lawsuit . the court held that , based on the evidence and the statements of the parties , it can be determined that the vehicle key is kept by the plaintiff , and the defendant will release the parked vehicle after charging the parking fee based on the parking certificate , and does not review the other conditions of the parked vehicle and the driver . this kind of situation does not meet the control and possession characteristics of the custodian in the storage contract . in addition , according to the actual situation in which the defendant charges a parking fee of 7 yuan per hour , it should not be presumed that the intention of the defendant to enter into the contract includes the willingness to bear the heavier obligation to keep the vehicle . the court finally determined the site lease contract relationship . however , some courts believe that parking the vehicle in the underground parking lot , and the vehicle is completely placed under the management of the underground parking lot , constitutes a delivery , so it is regarded as a storage contract . in the judgment of guangzhou intermediate people 's court of guangzhou city ( 2015 ) sui zhong fa min er zhong zi no . 1545 , the plaintiff 's vehicle was lost in the defendant 's parking lot , resulting in a lawsuit . the plaintiff parked the vehicle in the parking lot operated by the defendant . the vehicle involved in the case was completely under the management of the defendant.there was no situation in which the defendant delivered the parking lot involved to the plaintiff for use and profit . the plaintiff managed the vehicle on his own , and the plaintiff parked it . the behavior of the vehicle paid the defendant the corresponding parking fee , so a paid custody contract relationship was established between the two parties . the determination of the two contract relationships directly determines the proportion of the car park involved in the vehicle accident . under the determination of the site leasing contract relationship , the car park involved generally only bears about 30 % of the responsibility ; under the determination of the custody contract relationship , the car park involved assumes almost full responsibility . ent_3 told the " legal daily " reporter that some people in the industry believe that parking the vehicle in an underground parking lot is a service contract , " contains the provision of temporary venues and security management , and its management and protection obligations are lower than general storage . the contract is similar to the parking space rented in the community . the user pays two fees , one is the rental fee for the parking space owner , and the other is the parking space property management fee for the property management . the commercial parking fee is similar to the combination of the two . " in this regard , beijing lawyer ent_4 believes that strengthening the security of underground parking is the legal responsibility and obligation of the parking lot management party . " the operating mode of the residential parking lot is the toll parking mode , and the parking lot of the commercial premises adopts the two modes of toll parking or shopping consumption free parking . " ent_4 said that no matter which mode the parking lot is operated in , the public will drive the car into the parking lot . after that , a consumer service contract relationship was established with the parking lot management party . according to relevant laws and regulations , after the conclusion of the consumer service contract , the parking lot management party has the responsibility and obligation to provide a safe parking environment for the car owner , and protect the personal and property safety of the car owner within his own ability . " if someone commits robbery in an underground parking lot , resulting in damage to the personal or property of the consumer , the parking lot management party has faults and has not fulfilled its security responsibilities , the injured person or the victim can demand the management party to bear civil compensation liability " ent_4 said .

" said a woman who picked up the car . on the afternoon of july 30 , a reporter from the legal daily came to the youtang shopping center in chaoyang district , beijing , where various businesses gathered , but the environment of its underground parking lot is not optimistic - next to the down channel there are many vehicles parked , and the lights of the entire down channel are weak , and the vehicles enter the underground parking lot as if crossing a " black hole " . at the entrance of the parking lot on the negative fourth floor , only two or three people were on duty . in this parking area that accommodates two or three hundred motor vehicles , the reporter did not find that the property management staff patrolled and the cell phone signal was relatively poor . at around 10:30 on july 31 , a reporter from the legal daily came to the underground parking lot of yidigang in chaoyang district , beijing . the underground parking lot is divided into two floors , and each floor is visually as large as two football fields . the lights in the two - storey car park are dim , but traffic signs and safety exit signs are relatively complete . convex reflectors are installed at the sharp bends of the intersections . the lanes and sidewalks are distinguished by different colors . the ground and walls have clear pointing signs . surveillance cameras are installed in different directions . even so , a number of customers told the " legal daily " reporter that the intersection in the underground parking lot is complicated , like a maze , and it is easy to get lost . in the yidigang underground parking lot , a reporter from the " legal daily " asked the toll booth staff to learn that the underground parking lot has 3 exits , and there are security personnel on foot in the parking lot to patrol regularly , and the security director drives the patrol car patrol . the reporter questioned that no patrol was seen in the parking lot . the staff stated that the parking lot was very large and the patrol on foot took a long time , so the patrol staff might not be seen . then , a reporter from legal daily came to the underground parking lot of jingdu international community near yidi port . the parking lot was right next to the community gate . the reporter walked into the underground parking lot , and the security guard at the gate of the community did not interrogate or block it . after entering the underground parking lot of the community , the reporter found that the light in the parking lot was dim and there were only a few fluorescent lamps overhead . there is no convex reflector at the corner of the entrance of the underground parking lot , and the driver 's sight is easily obstructed . the reporter walked along the road to the bottom of the slope and found that a police box on the left was lit with a small electric fan and a water cup , but no one was on duty . the reporter continued to follow the direction of the exit indicated by the road signs and walked to the exit without seeing the surveillance camera . in the meantime , the reporter 's cell phone had no signal . the exit of the parking lot has only the automatic license plate recognition system and is unattended . the parking lot exit is next to the other gate of the community . the reporter asked the security guard at the door whether the parking lot was managed by him . the security guard denied that the underground parking lot was managed by the community property . asked where the manager was , the security guard said he did n't know . the reporter then walked in from the exit of the parking lot again , and the security guards did not stop . when i came to the post inside the parking lot i found again , there was still no managerial staff in the post . fire hazards are large in addition to security risks , underground parking lots are also high - fire areas . at 22:15 on july 27 , the zhenhai fire department of ningbo city , zhejiang province received the police , and the underground parking lot in the high - rise residential area of jinxiu jiangnan , zhenhai , caught fire ; the morning of june 8 , hangzhou city , zhejiang province lu qingyi garden 's underground parking lot caught fire ; in the afternoon of february 22 , the underground parking lot of no . 3 building of hexinyuan community near the intersection of yueyang road and xi'an road in heping district , tianjin suddenly burst into smoke . many fire trucks did not put out the fire until they arrived at the scene ... according to ent_2 of beijing urban construction design and development group co. , ltd . , the large underground parking lot has a small exhaust hole area and low heat dissipation performance , so a fire occurs . at that time , the heat dissipation is slow , the internal temperature of the underground parking lot rises faster , and the indoor air volume increases faster , resulting in increased indoor pressure , plus the large underground parking space of large commercial buildings , up and down , left and right connected together , the interior decoration of the car is mostly made of polyurethane synthetic materials , which is easy to burn . once a fire occurs , the fire will spread quickly , causing serious fire accidents . in addition , the underground parking lot of large underground commercial buildings is prone to " flashover " . when the fire spreads further , the indoor air composition will also change , and the indoor temperature will continue to rise , resulting in greater indoor pressure , resulting in greater indoor pressure . the original wind direction of the air flow changes , and the pressure of the wind flow continues to increase . after some of the wind pressure reaches the exit , it will return to the room with the fresh air at the entrance and flow in the opposite direction , thereby expanding the fire and causing greater fire hazard . " large underground commercial buildings have more internal functions , and the design form of internal buildings is also more complicated , and the design of their underground parking lots is relatively complicated , which is easy to cause people to have emergency situations in underground parking lots . people look for the direction of safe exits . " ent_2 said , especially the design passages and exits of underground parking lots in some commercial squares are one - way , and there is no clear sign for consumer safety exits . another serious problem is that the safe evacuation passages or exits in underground garages of large underground commercial buildings are not spacious enough , which will affect the evacuation of vehicles . " legal daily " reporter found in the investigation that it is not uncommon for parking spaces to occupy safe passages and cars to block safety doors in underground parking lots with high staff density such as supermarkets or underground parking lots in residential areas with tight parking spaces . in a residential area of shuangyushu road , haidian district , beijing , a car owner parked a motor vehicle on the evacuation passage of an underground parking lot.pedestrians have to stand sideways , and it would be more inconvenient to carry big bags if you are not careful , you will hit the door or rearview mirror . in the underground parking lot of mingdujiayuan community , fengtai district , beijing , there are few parking spaces on file , but there are actually multiple parking spaces , some of which are located before the safe exit , and there are potential safety hazards . disputes are difficult to handle zhao jiaxin , from dalian , liaoning province . on may 14 , 2017 , after parking in the underground parking lot of the roosevelt mall on xi'an road in dalian , zhao jiaxin 's vehicle was scratched . at 18:39 that day , zhao jiaxin drove into the underground parking lot attached to the mall and parked his car in the clearly marked parking space . " there are no problems such as crimping , occupying roads , obstructing other vehicles , etc . i just parked in the parking space properly . however , around 20:40 , when i returned to the parking lot , i noticed that the door on the right side of my car had obvious i traced the traces , and i immediately asked the staff to explain the situation . the security guard told me that i could n't get the monitoring and required police authorization . " immediately , zhao jiaxin went to the traffic police detachment for help.after obtaining the authorization from the police , the staff of the underground parking lot called for monitoring , and found that the parking place was monitoring dead spots . " i found that when monitoring the parking lot , there were many dead spots in the underground parking lot , and no vehicles were photographed . the process , but the camera at the entrance of the parking lot clearly showed that my car did not have any scars when entering the park . " zhao jiaxin told the " legal daily " reporter , " in the whole process of the incident , i am still very satisfied with the handling of the traffic police . the traffic police 's reply is , ' if the car collides during driving , it is under the jurisdiction of the traffic police , but the car is parked in the parking lot , and the car damage occurs at a standstill . it is not within the jurisdiction of the traffic police . it should also be the responsibility of the local police station ' " . zhao jiaxin then reported to the police station . " the police at the police station was very timely , and the police stationed twice before and after , but the police at the police station said that this matter is not within their jurisdiction . if i can coordinate with the parking lot best , i can only go to court to prosecute if i ca n't coordinate . hundred yuan went to the court to sue , and the delay could not be afforded . " zhao jiaxin said . in zhao jiaxin 's view , this matter should be the responsibility of the parking lot , " but the person in charge of the shopping mall clearly told me that the shopping mall does not bear any responsibility , the basis of the charge is to provide a parking space , the car is rubbed and need to find the perpetrator and , the mall has been helping me to retrieve surveillance video . according to the attitude of the mall , this thing seems to happen on the road , not in the toll parking lot of the mall . " the final solution is that zhao jiaxin sent the car to the 4s shop and spent 500 yuan for maintenance . " because the amount is not large , it is not worth the insurance . " " legal daily " reporter found in the investigation that after the dispute in the underground parking lot , in the process of handling , the contractual relationship between the owner and the parking lot often became the focus of dispute . in this regard , beijing lawyer ent_3 said in an interview with a reporter from legal daily that the vehicle is parked in an underground parking lot , and the vehicle driver has formed a contractual relationship with the management of the underground parking lot . during the parking period , if the vehicle is damaged due to a third party , the owner or the driver of the vehicle may claim compensation from the underground parking lot management party according to the contract law . after the underground parking lot management party assumes the compensation liability , it may recover the damage from the perpetrator . ent_3 said , however , even if it is handled according to the contract law , there are still differences , namely the dispute between the site lease contract and the custody contract . in 2015 , shanghai no . 1 intermediate people 's court made a judgment in a similar case . in the case heard by the shanghai first intermediate people 's court , the plaintiff 's vehicle was damaged in the defendant 's underground parking lot , which brought a lawsuit . the court held that , based on the evidence and the statements of the parties , it can be determined that the vehicle key is kept by the plaintiff , and the defendant will release the parked vehicle after charging the parking fee based on the parking certificate , and does not review the other conditions of the parked vehicle and the driver . this kind of situation does not meet the control and possession characteristics of the custodian in the storage contract . in addition , according to the actual situation in which the defendant charges a parking fee of 7 yuan per hour , it should not be presumed that the intention of the defendant to enter into the contract includes the willingness to bear the heavier obligation to keep the vehicle . the court finally determined the site lease contract relationship . however , some courts believe that parking the vehicle in the underground parking lot , and the vehicle is completely placed under the management of the underground parking lot , constitutes a delivery , so it is regarded as a storage contract . in the judgment of guangzhou intermediate people 's court of guangzhou city ( 2015 ) sui zhong fa min er zhong zi no . 1545 , the plaintiff 's vehicle was lost in the defendant 's parking lot , resulting in a lawsuit . the plaintiff parked the vehicle in the parking lot operated by the defendant . the vehicle involved in the case was completely under the management of the defendant.there was no situation in which the defendant delivered the parking lot involved to the plaintiff for use and profit . the plaintiff managed the vehicle on his own , and the plaintiff parked it . the behavior of the vehicle paid the defendant the corresponding parking fee , so a paid custody contract relationship was established between the two parties . the determination of the two contract relationships directly determines the proportion of the car park involved in the vehicle accident . under the determination of the site leasing contract relationship , the car park involved generally only bears about 30 % of the responsibility ; under the determination of the custody contract relationship , the car park involved assumes almost full responsibility . ent_3 told the " legal daily " reporter that some people in the industry believe that parking the vehicle in an underground parking lot is a service contract , " contains the provision of temporary venues and security management , and its management and protection obligations are lower than general storage . the contract is similar to the parking space rented in the community . the user pays two fees , one is the rental fee for the parking space owner , and the other is the parking space property management fee for the property management . the commercial parking fee is similar to the combination of the two . " in this regard , beijing lawyer ent_4 believes that strengthening the security of underground parking is the legal responsibility and obligation of the parking lot management party . " the operating mode of the residential parking lot is the toll parking mode , and the parking lot of the commercial premises adopts the two modes of toll parking or shopping consumption free parking . " ent_4 said that no matter which mode the parking lot is operated in , the public will drive the car into the parking lot . after that , a consumer service contract relationship was established with the parking lot management party . according to relevant laws and regulations , after the conclusion of the consumer service contract , the parking lot management party has the responsibility and obligation to provide a safe parking environment for the car owner , and protect the personal and property safety of the car owner within his own ability . " if someone commits robbery in an underground parking lot , resulting in damage to the personal or property of the consumer , the parking lot management party has faults and has not fulfilled its security responsibilities , the injured person or the victim can demand the management party to bear civil compensation liability " ent_4 said .

the seemingly unrelated two people , through the meticulous handling of the case by the prosecutor , revealed clues ; they thought it was just an ordinary traffic accident , and even the family of the victim was kept in the dark . finally , the prosecutor carefully combed the complete chain of evidence next , the truth surfaced . on january 15 this year , the defendant guo yong , prosecuted by zhengzhou high - tech zone procuratorate in henan province , was indicted by the court in the first instance and sentenced guo yong to 15 years in prison . guo yong refused to accept the judgment of the first instance and appealed . recently , the zhengzhou intermediate court made a final judgment on the case : dismiss the appeal and uphold the original judgment . hitting people and escaping , trying to cover up the phone , let him show his feet . " i pass by the door of your shop , and i see a person lying on the doorway . please go and see ! " on the afternoon of april 16 , 2017 , a steaming shop was opened in zhengzhou economic development zone tangmou received a call from guo yong , the salesman who was handling his loan recently . ent_0 thought that it was a loan , but guo yong told him that there was a traffic accident in front of the store . although the content of the phone is a bit strange , ent_0 hurried to the door to check the situation . sure enough , there was a person lying on the road in front of the store . it was the guest ent_1 who had just come out of tang 's store . tang quickly called the police . however , when tang wanted to find li 's mobile phone to notify his family , he could not find li 's bags and clothing pockets . at about 7 pm that day , tang received a call from guo yong again . during the call , guo yong kept asking about li 's injury and the hospital where he was . this made tang feel even more strange . " did you hit it ? " after hearing tang 's question , guo yong on the phone denied it and quickly hung up . that night , tang received a call from guo yong again . during the call , guo yong kept asking the hospital where li was located , and claimed that he had business contacts and wanted to visit the hospital . after hearing about guo yong 's abnormal behavior , li 's family determined that guo yong was the perpetrator who injured li . in the early hours of april 17th , li 's family met guo yong outside the ward but were afraid to enter the ward . he wanted to ask him about the situation . he never thought guo yong saw li 's family turning his head and ran away . phone dropped on the stairs . it is this mobile phone that became the key to expose guo yong 's criminal behavior . there are many doubts , and the prosecutor carefully handled the case to seek the truth . one month after the accident , ent_1 died after rescue . it was identified that the lee family died of severe craniocerebral injury due to greater blunt external force . on july 11 of the same year , the public security organ transferred guo yong to the procuratorate of zhengzhou high - tech zone for review and prosecution on suspicion of traffic accident . after the case was accepted by the procuratorate of zhengzhou high - tech zone , the contractor zhang jiao carefully reviewed the case materials . after analyzing the case , it was found that the scene monitoring video showed that the road where the incident occurred in the afternoon was wide on the road and the traffic was scarce . after ent_1 came out of the tang shop guo guo then drove an electric car to ent_1 and knocked it down . after that , guo yong returned to the scene again and took ent_1 's mobile phone , then fled the scene . when questioning guo yong , he argued that because there was a driving vehicle on the opposite side that could not be avoided , he crashed into ent_1 . as for why lee took the phone at the scene , guo yong explained inconsistently . the explanation of how to know that the mobile phone belongs to li is contradictory . therefore , zhang jiao believes that this case is not an ordinary traffic accident . on august 26 , the court returned the case to the investigative agency for additional investigation . in view of the complexity of the case , the procuratorate of zhengzhou high - tech zone actively coordinated the criminal investigation brigade of the public security organs , deployed police officers with relevant experience in handling cases to assist the traffic police brigade to investigate and collect evidence in this case , collect relevant testimonial materials , and further guide the investigation to strengthen the evidence . the absurd feelings pushed her to death . when she asked the victim 's family again , li 's husband wang mou told zhang jiao an undiscovered fact . during li 's rescue , wang accidentally discovered that guo yong 's cell phone that was dropped in the hospital was actually li ' s. when he looked at his wife 's wechat chat , he found that li and guo yong had a month before the incident . a special relationship . is this special relationship just a coincidence with li 's car accident ? after investigation , guo yong has been imprisoned several times for fraud . at the end of 2016 , after guo yong was released from prison again , he has been claiming to be able to apply for loans near a logistics park in the economic development zone of zhengzhou , and has defrauded the loan deposits of many merchants . tang is also one of them . when going to tang 's store to promote " business " , guo yong met li and the two added wechat friends . in the chat , ent_1 complained to guo yong about the unsatisfactory marital life . guo yong 's sweet words made ent_1 lose his way . soon the two opened a room in a nearby hotel ... but guo yong 's scam will be exposed sooner or later merchants who had previously applied for loans kept asking when they could get the loan , and guo yong 's vomiting lies and inconsistent behaviors also made li understand the person of guo yong and proposed to break up with guo yong . what li did not expect was that guo yong did not intend to break up with her . instead , after li knew of his fraud , he told the family of li to threaten him and let him leave zhengzhou with him . on the day of the incident , after ent_1 refused guo yong 's request again , guo yong drove an electric car to the door of ent_1 's house , took a photo of li 's child , and sent it to li . in wechat , guo yong claimed that he would do everything while taking advantage of the wine and threatened to hurt li 's children , but li did not take guo yong 's threats seriously . before the incident , li went out of tang 's shop and received a call from guo yong , and the two quarreled again on the phone . li did not know that guo yong was not far behind her at this time . after she hung up guo yong 's phone , the grinning guo yong drove an electric car and slammed into her . in the face of interrogation by the prosecutor , guo yong still persuaded that he did not know ent_1 , but just accidentally hit someone . however , when guo yong saw a screenshot of his wechat conversation with ent_1 , he lowered his head . what awaits him will be another long prison life .

" \ nmilwaukee , usa ent_4 , president of the manufacturers ' association , said : " we represent the industry 's 1.3 million equipment manufacturing workers urging the trump administration not to impose tariff measures that will harm the economy . we strongly oppose provoking a trade war with china because of the tit - for - tat no one will be a winner in trade frictions . tariffs are taxes on american consumers , and the increase in tariffs will also put employment in related industries in the united states at risk . " \ nin response to the trump administration 's rebellion , it may trigger a blind trade war with china . ent_5 , chief global strategic analyst at horizon investments , believes that the sino - us trade tensions will have four negative effects on the us : rising inflation , dragged down economic growth in agricultural states , and long - term corporate planning due to uncertainty become more complicated and the united states is increasingly isolated on the world stage . \ nhigh - frequency trading giant virtu financial 's trader ent_6 told xinhua reporter that if the sino - us trade friction escalates , " the us job market will be affected , especially in the construction industry , automotive industry and agriculture . will continue to pay attention to the depth and breadth of impact .

" routine loan " is a form of fraud that illegally possesses the property of the victim under the name of " borrowing " . the lender wants the borrower to return the principal and pay high interest as agreed , in order to obtain the victim 's property . recently , ent_0 reporters in hangzhou , zhejiang , interviewed several clients who were defrauded by routine loans . they used their own personal experience to reveal the scam to us . victim xiao chen : when i was in college , i was exposed to this campus loan . at the beginning , there were only four or five thousand debts , but the debts could not be paid later . then through another campus loan , one by one . later it was more than 100,000 debts . xiao chen , 24 , a native of hangzhou , spent a lot of money while attending college , and owed more than 100,000 yuan in campus loans . last summer , xiao chen graduated and returned home , and met the usury intermediary feng mou through the internet . feng heard that the old house of xiao chen 's family was about to be demolished , which was an ideal " routine " object , so he promised xiao chen to help him with loans and use these loans to repay the previously owed campus loans . in july 2017 , xiao chen was taken by feng mou to the office of lender ji mou . victim xiao chen : when i went to his ( ji mou ) office , he offered to borrow 30,000 , but only got 10,000 . the cost in the middle is the platform fee , interest , and the deposit must be deducted . piecemeal deduction of 20,000 , i can only get 10,000 yuan . the interest is paid every ten days , which is three thousand interest . reporter : is there 3,000 interest in ten days ? xiao chen : yes , then i have to pay an intermediary fee of 4,000 yuan to the intermediary ( feng mou ) . so in fact , if i borrowed 30,000 yuan , i only got 6,000 yuan . with a loan of 30,000 yuan , only 6,000 were actually available , and the more exaggerated is still behind . reporter : how was the loan note written ? xiao chen : write two loan notes . he said , in order to prevent me from going up , and then they can sue , so they have to add one more . their argument is to borrow one and bet one . i wrote two 30,000 notes , a total of 60,000 . borrowing 10,000 yuan , writing 300,000 debits , sort out how xiao chen borrowed the money . first of all , at the request of the other party , xiao chen signed a total of two debits , each 30,000 , with a total amount of 60,000 , and xiao chen actually got only 6,000 yuan . in addition , xiao chen also pays an interest of 3,000 yuan every ten days . even if it is not a profit , this is actually a 6,000 yuan loan with an annual interest rate of 1825 % . the highest annual interest rate of private loans supported by china 's laws is 36 % . what happened to xiao chen after borrowing this loan shark that has exceeded the normal borrowing limit of 50 times the interest rate ? victim xiao chen : because i need more than 10,000 , the six thousand borrowed that day is not enough . then i found a second one through that agent . it is also in this form . with this interest , i received more than 10,000 yuan , and then i paid about 8,000 for the agency . this time , xiao chen was still asked by the other party to sign two debits , with a total amount of 60,000 yuan , but actually 8,000 yuan . only these two times , xiao chen 's debt has increased by 120,000 , and he actually received less than 14,000 yuan . however , this was just the beginning of a nightmare , because he was unable to repay the money on time . xiao chen was taken by this lender to other loan sharks to borrow money and repay some of the arrears of the previous loan in a similar way to demolishing the east wall to fill the west wall . then the lender then took xiao chen to find a third one , with the same means , so that xiao chen 's debts were continuously increased . victim xiao chen : they took me everywhere to borrow money . for almost a month , i wrote more than 300,000 debits . originally , i borrowed 10,000 yuan , and in less than a month , i wrote more than 300,000 loans , and i incurred more than 300,000 in debt . however , the purpose of these lenders is not just to let xiao chenduo repay some loan sharks , their ultimate goal is to defraud the xiao chen family 's property waiting to be demolished . for example , ji mou , the lender who first lent money to xiao chen , once used an electric baton to shock xiao chen 's body , forcing him to ask for money and debts from his family . take chen 's household registration book . not only that , jimou and others also came to collect debts from time to time , causing the chen family to be " chicken and dog restless . " this made the mother chen , who had been in bed at home due to illness , become more and more serious . victim xiao chen : actually , they were interested in the demolition of my family , and then they tried to find ways to make me write more invoices . i hid in the middle for a while , but they were also found and beaten by them . in january of this year , the disturbing mother chen suddenly died in her anger . because of hiding debts abroad , xiao chen failed to send her mother a final trip . mother chen 's affair was handled by the relatives of the chen family , and then the relatives gathered money to help xiao chen pay off more than 350,000 yuan of debt . until then , xiao chen , who was hiding from the debts , dared to show up and finally chose the police . huang jianbo , a policeman from the chengxiang police station of the public security bureau of xiaoshan district in hangzhou city : through the case of xiao chen , we arrested ji and other suspects , and verified 12 cases , involving more than 4 million yuan . generally speaking , young people who have just stepped into the society are selected . those who have no social experience at the age of 24 or 25 are natives of xiaoshan . they all have real estate at home . after reaching the ideal goal , dunning at home . xiao lu , a 28-year - old young woman forced to borrow money to buy a mobile phone to buy a mobile phone , is another victim of a routine loan contacted by reporters in hangzhou . she and the previous victim xiao chen have the same characteristics : young , not involved in the world , and thinking simple . she was lured by the scammers to force them to sign dozens of invoices , and even wrote down the mortgage agreement of the house 's real estate . and everything is just caused by a high - end mobile phone . ent_1 , who is not married , and her parents and grandparents lived in an ordinary house in the countryside of xiaoshan district , hangzhou city . ent_1 said that the story of his routine would start with an apple phone . victim ent_1 : at that time , the value of ( apple ) mobile phone was 7200 . they said that it was three loans for one mobile phone . at that time , three loans were borrowed , about 12,000 yuan . slower . in order to repay the mobile phone loan , two months later , ent_1 borrowed more than 10 small loans , with a total loan amount of about 100,000 yuan , and actually received 80,000 yuan . the money paid off the mobile phone loan and its interest and liquidated damages , but the subsequent microloan continued to generate interest and liquidated damages , and it did n't take long for ent_1 to start worrying again . victim ent_1 : there are more petty ( small ) loans , and they do n't come out at all , so they go to usury loans . they say that they are free , and they borrowed 30,000 . he said that 10 days of interest is 3000 or 6000 . at that time , my brain went away as soon as it was hot . by the 11th day , he said let me repay the principal and interest , because the loan note said 60,000 yuan , and he said let me repay 66000 , and then i said there was no money , he said that otherwise you would go ( other places ) and borrowed our pen . later , ent_1 was taken to another lender , ji , and ji proposed to go to ent_1 's house to look at it . after confirming that ent_1 's house had real estate , jimou agreed to borrow . victim xiao lu : he gave 9,000 yuan . if he had to pay it back , he would have to pay 30,000 yuan . reporter : it was 30,000 you wrote on the loan note ? xiao lu : it was 40,000 written on the loan note . reporter : how much did you actually get ? xiao lu : 9000 . reporter : the obvious inequality is fraud and blackmailing you . at xiao lu 's home , the reporter saw some of the invoices , and these alone no fewer than twenty . in less than four months , xiao lu was forced by the other party to borrow dozens of loans from various places . victim xiao lu : because i borrowed it in the front , i could n't clean it up in the back , because it was like a snowball , it was too big , and the hole could n't be blocked at all . this mortgage loan contract was written after xiao lu borrowed countless amounts of money . xiao lu told reporters that the other party wanted to use this contract to defraud xiao lu 's house . however , because the property was under ent_1 's parents ' name , the other party frequently harassed and persecuted at home in order to put pressure on her parents . reporter : how many times did they come before and after ? victim ent_1 's mother : there are 20 days . they are all batch after batch , today you come tomorrow he will come . reporter : when they threaten your home in various ways , what kind of means are you most afraid of ? xiao lu 's mother : they told me that she ( xiao lu ) also has a sister . xiao lu ) is like this . the younger ( daughter ) made you kidnapped . what happened to our family , so i said the money must be given back to you . afterwards , his parents hurriedly borrowed more than 300,000 yuan to help his daughter repay part of the arrears , but some still failed to pay it off . at this time , the other party offered to let xiao lu 's parents borrow money from them . victim ent_1 's mother : let me borrow from them . i said that i have to pay you the house i borrowed from you , no matter where you borrow our family . xiao lu 's mother said that , fortunately , she had withstood the pressure and did not sign the mortgage contract signed by her daughter . otherwise , her entire family had become the target of scammers and eventually fell to the streets.the intention to build up debts seems to be a fraud on ent_1 's home . in addition to dozens of borrowings , the reporter also saw nearly ten indictments and verdicts , because some lenders have been sued for holding false high borrowings written by ent_1 . when they arrived at the court , the loans , the amount of the loan , the liability for breach of contract , etc . were clearly written in black and white . the court can only hear ordinary private lending disputes . some cases have also been judged , and xiao lu lost the law and repaid the money . those who are still under review are not optimistic . this photo was taken when the victim ent_1 borrowed a routine loan . this kind of picture has been taken by almost all the victims of routine loans . why did the other party take this picture ? the police officer of the criminal investigation brigade , xiaoshan district , hangzhou city , fuda : for example , my contract is 30,000 . my loan name is borrowing 10,000 yuan , it is 5,000 yuan in my hand . he will make bank water , transfer it to your card or wechat , and transfer the money according to the contract amount ( 30,000 ) to make water for you . he asks you to remind at the time , he produced all kinds of evidence in favor of himself , and he can provide it to your family . if your family members are not willing to pay this money , he can also go directly to the court to sue based on the evidence . in fact , the court is very likely to support his lawsuit . the lender will first let the borrower sign two loan contracts that are both 30,000 yuan , and then transfer 30,000 yuan to the borrower , and then create a 30,000 yuan bank flow ; then lure to force the borrower to withdraw cash and let him take it out 30,000 yuan in cash to take pictures , which proves that they gave the borrower another 30,000 yuan in cash , plus 30,000 before the bank transfer , which is a total of 60,000 yuan . of course , after taking the picture , in addition to the five thousand yuan , the rest of the money must be taken away by the lender and the intermediary . in this way , no matter who it is , the borrower borrowed 60,000 yuan from the lender , not the actual 5,000 yuan . of course , if the lender asks the borrower for an amount of 60,000 yuan , the borrower will not easily recognize it . at this time , the lender will take various measures to force the borrower to repay the money according to the falsely high amount in the contract . among them are beatings , injuries and illegal detentions . this is a video that hangzhou xiaoshan police seized from a suspect 's mobile phone in a recent special operation against routine loans . according to the suspects , they were using electric batons to shock the borrower , forcing him to continue to borrow money to repay the debt . huang jianbo , a policeman of the chengxiang police station of the xiaoshan district public security

" routine loan " is a form of fraud that illegally possesses the property of the victim under the name of " borrowing " . the lender wants the borrower to return the principal and pay high interest as agreed , in order to obtain the victim 's property . recently , ent_0 reporters in hangzhou , zhejiang , interviewed several clients who were defrauded by routine loans . they used their own personal experience to reveal the scam to us . victim xiao chen : when i was in college , i was exposed to this campus loan . at the beginning , there were only four or five thousand debts , but the debts could not be paid later . then through another campus loan , one by one . later it was more than 100,000 debts . xiao chen , 24 , a native of hangzhou , spent a lot of money while attending college , and owed more than 100,000 yuan in campus loans . last summer , xiao chen graduated and returned home , and met the usury intermediary feng mou through the internet . feng heard that the old house of xiao chen 's family was about to be demolished , which was an ideal " routine " object , so he promised xiao chen to help him with loans and use these loans to repay the previously owed campus loans . in july 2017 , xiao chen was taken by feng mou to the office of lender ji mou . victim xiao chen : when i went to his ( ji mou ) office , he offered to borrow 30,000 , but only got 10,000 . the cost in the middle is the platform fee , interest , and the deposit must be deducted . piecemeal deduction of 20,000 , i can only get 10,000 yuan . the interest is paid every ten days , which is three thousand interest . reporter : is there 3,000 interest in ten days ? xiao chen : yes , then i have to pay an intermediary fee of 4,000 yuan to the intermediary ( feng mou ) . so in fact , if i borrowed 30,000 yuan , i only got 6,000 yuan . with a loan of 30,000 yuan , only 6,000 were actually available , and the more exaggerated is still behind . reporter : how was the loan note written ? xiao chen : write two loan notes . he said , in order to prevent me from going up , and then they can sue , so they have to add one more . their argument is to borrow one and bet one . i wrote two 30,000 notes , a total of 60,000 . borrowing 10,000 yuan , writing 300,000 debits , sort out how xiao chen borrowed the money . first of all , at the request of the other party , xiao chen signed a total of two debits , each 30,000 , with a total amount of 60,000 , and xiao chen actually got only 6,000 yuan . in addition , xiao chen also pays an interest of 3,000 yuan every ten days . even if it is not a profit , this is actually a 6,000 yuan loan with an annual interest rate of 1825 % . the highest annual interest rate of private loans supported by china 's laws is 36 % . what happened to xiao chen after borrowing this loan shark that has exceeded the normal borrowing limit of 50 times the interest rate ? victim xiao chen : because i need more than 10,000 , the six thousand borrowed that day is not enough . then i found a second one through that agent . it is also in this form . with this interest , i received more than 10,000 yuan , and then i paid about 8,000 for the agency . this time , xiao chen was still asked by the other party to sign two debits , with a total amount of 60,000 yuan , but actually 8,000 yuan . only these two times , xiao chen 's debt has increased by 120,000 , and he actually received less than 14,000 yuan . however , this was just the beginning of a nightmare , because he was unable to repay the money on time . xiao chen was taken by this lender to other loan sharks to borrow money and repay some of the arrears of the previous loan in a similar way to demolishing the east wall to fill the west wall . then the lender then took xiao chen to find a third one , with the same means , so that xiao chen 's debts were continuously increased . victim xiao chen : they took me everywhere to borrow money . for almost a month , i wrote more than 300,000 debits . originally , i borrowed 10,000 yuan , and in less than a month , i wrote more than 300,000 loans , and i incurred more than 300,000 in debt . however , the purpose of these lenders is not just to let xiao chenduo repay some loan sharks , their ultimate goal is to defraud the xiao chen family 's property waiting to be demolished . for example , ji mou , the lender who first lent money to xiao chen , once used an electric baton to shock xiao chen 's body , forcing him to ask for money and debts from his family . take chen 's household registration book . not only that , jimou and others also came to collect debts from time to time , causing the chen family to be " chicken and dog restless . " this made the mother chen , who had been in bed at home due to illness , become more and more serious . victim xiao chen : actually , they were interested in the demolition of my family , and then they tried to find ways to make me write more invoices . i hid in the middle for a while , but they were also found and beaten by them . in january of this year , the disturbing mother chen suddenly died in her anger . because of hiding debts abroad , xiao chen failed to send her mother a final trip . mother chen 's affair was handled by the relatives of the chen family , and then the relatives gathered money to help xiao chen pay off more than 350,000 yuan of debt . until then , xiao chen , who was hiding from the debts , dared to show up and finally chose the police . huang jianbo , a policeman from the chengxiang police station of the public security bureau of xiaoshan district in hangzhou city : through the case of xiao chen , we arrested ji and other suspects , and verified 12 cases , involving more than 4 million yuan . generally speaking , young people who have just stepped into the society are selected . those who have no social experience at the age of 24 or 25 are natives of xiaoshan . they all have real estate at home . after reaching the ideal goal , dunning at home . xiao lu , a 28-year - old young woman forced to borrow money to buy a mobile phone to buy a mobile phone , is another victim of a routine loan contacted by reporters in hangzhou . she and the previous victim xiao chen have the same characteristics : young , not involved in the world , and thinking simple . she was lured by the scammers to force them to sign dozens of invoices , and even wrote down the mortgage agreement of the house 's real estate . and everything is just caused by a high - end mobile phone . ent_1 , who is not married , and her parents and grandparents lived in an ordinary house in the countryside of xiaoshan district , hangzhou city . ent_1 said that the story of his routine would start with an apple phone . victim ent_1 : at that time , the value of ( apple ) mobile phone was 7200 . they said that it was three loans for one mobile phone . at that time , three loans were borrowed , about 12,000 yuan . slower . in order to repay the mobile phone loan , two months later , ent_1 borrowed more than 10 small loans , with a total loan amount of about 100,000 yuan , and actually received 80,000 yuan . the money paid off the mobile phone loan and its interest and liquidated damages , but the subsequent microloan continued to generate interest and liquidated damages , and it did n't take long for ent_1 to start worrying again . victim ent_1 : there are more petty ( small ) loans , and they do n't come out at all , so they go to usury loans . they say that they are free , and they borrowed 30,000 . he said that 10 days of interest is 3000 or 6000 . at that time , my brain went away as soon as it was hot . by the 11th day , he said let me repay the principal and interest , because the loan note said 60,000 yuan , and he said let me repay 66000 , and then i said there was no money , he said that otherwise you would go ( other places ) and borrowed our pen . later , ent_1 was taken to another lender , ji , and ji proposed to go to ent_1 's house to look at it . after confirming that ent_1 's house had real estate , jimou agreed to borrow . victim xiao lu : he gave 9,000 yuan . if he had to pay it back , he would have to pay 30,000 yuan . reporter : it was 30,000 you wrote on the loan note ? xiao lu : it was 40,000 written on the loan note . reporter : how much did you actually get ? xiao lu : 9000 . reporter : the obvious inequality is fraud and blackmailing you . at xiao lu 's home , the reporter saw some of the invoices , and these alone no fewer than twenty . in less than four months , xiao lu was forced by the other party to borrow dozens of loans from various places . victim xiao lu : because i borrowed it in the front , i could n't clean it up in the back , because it was like a snowball , it was too big , and the hole could n't be blocked at all . this mortgage loan contract was written after xiao lu borrowed countless amounts of money . xiao lu told reporters that the other party wanted to use this contract to defraud xiao lu 's house . however , because the property was under ent_1 's parents ' name , the other party frequently harassed and persecuted at home in order to put pressure on her parents . reporter : how many times did they come before and after ? victim ent_1 's mother : there are 20 days . they are all batch after batch , today you come tomorrow he will come . reporter : when they threaten your home in various ways , what kind of means are you most afraid of ? xiao lu 's mother : they told me that she ( xiao lu ) also has a sister . xiao lu ) is like this . the younger ( daughter ) made you kidnapped . what happened to our family , so i said the money must be given back to you . afterwards , his parents hurriedly borrowed more than 300,000 yuan to help his daughter repay part of the arrears , but some still failed to pay it off . at this time , the other party offered to let xiao lu 's parents borrow money from them . victim ent_1 's mother : let me borrow from them . i said that i have to pay you the house i borrowed from you , no matter where you borrow our family . xiao lu 's mother said that , fortunately , she had withstood the pressure and did not sign the mortgage contract signed by her daughter . otherwise , her entire family had become the target of scammers and eventually fell to the streets.the intention to build up debts seems to be a fraud on ent_1 's home . in addition to dozens of borrowings , the reporter also saw nearly ten indictments and verdicts , because some lenders have been sued for holding false high borrowings written by ent_1 . when they arrived at the court , the loans , the amount of the loan , the liability for breach of contract , etc . were clearly written in black and white . the court can only hear ordinary private lending disputes . some cases have also been judged , and xiao lu lost the law and repaid the money . those who are still under review are not optimistic . this photo was taken when the victim ent_1 borrowed a routine loan . this kind of picture has been taken by almost all the victims of routine loans . why did the other party take this picture ? the police officer of the criminal investigation brigade , xiaoshan district , hangzhou city , fuda : for example , my contract is 30,000 . my loan name is borrowing 10,000 yuan , it is 5,000 yuan in my hand . he will make bank water , transfer it to your card or wechat , and transfer the money according to the contract amount ( 30,000 ) to make water for you . he asks you to remind at the time , he produced all kinds of evidence in favor of himself , and he can provide it to your family . if your family members are not willing to pay this money , he can also go directly to the court to sue based on the evidence . in fact , the court is very likely to support his lawsuit . the lender will first let the borrower sign two loan contracts that are both 30,000 yuan , and then transfer 30,000 yuan to the borrower , and then create a 30,000 yuan bank flow ; then lure to force the borrower to withdraw cash and let him take it out 30,000 yuan in cash to take pictures , which proves that they gave the borrower another 30,000 yuan in cash , plus 30,000 before the bank transfer , which is a total of 60,000 yuan . of course , after taking the picture , in addition to the five thousand yuan , the rest of the money must be taken away by the lender and the intermediary . in this way , no matter who it is , the borrower borrowed 60,000 yuan from the lender , not the actual 5,000 yuan . of course , if the lender asks the borrower for an amount of 60,000 yuan , the borrower will not easily recognize it . at this time , the lender will take various measures to force the borrower to repay the money according to the falsely high amount in the contract . among them are beatings , injuries and illegal detentions . this is a video that hangzhou xiaoshan police seized from a suspect 's mobile phone in a recent special operation against routine loans . according to the suspects , they were using electric batons to shock the borrower , forcing him to continue to borrow money to repay the debt . huang jianbo , a policeman of the chengxiang police station of the xiaoshan district public security bureau in hangzhou : beaten , persecuted , and intimidated the male victims , forced the prostitution of women or accompanied with alcohol , and went to ktv to make money and repay the money . the police told reporters that all routine loan gangs will conduct a property investigation on the borrower before making each payment , and formulate a thorough fraud plan and a clear target for embezzlement . borrowers can have no car and no house , but as long as their parents have a car , a house and property , they are all ideal targets . at the detention center , feng mou , a criminal suspect involved in the fraud of xiao chen and xiao lu , also confirmed this to reporters . suspect feng : ( others ) are also asking me in the car , can this person eat routines , i told them so , you knock it yourself , because i look at the conditions of his house , i estimate him the tolerable range at home is about 100,000 yuan , in case he still ca n't pay it , if he asks for money above , 100,000 yuan will definitely be paid back . police department building of the criminal investigation brigade , xiaoshan district public security bureau , hangzhou , fidelity : because he will decorate your house according to your family situation , whether there are cars or other fixed assets , he will finally see you how much this person can overwhelm the debt . intentionally building up debt is

recently , on the s11 pingru expressway , the k103 at the north - south direction , there is nearly 50 meters of smoke in the road , which seriously affects the sight of the drivers of passing vehicles , and you can still see an open fire outside the isolation fence . what is going on ? at 16:15 on the same day , the liuyang road administration brigade of ent_0 of hunan provincial expressway construction and development corporation received an alarm call saying that there were flames outside the isolation barrier on the north - south direction of k103 of pingru highway . the road members immediately went to check . immediately after arriving at the scene , the road members noticed that several open fires could be seen where the barrier fence was out of sight . the fire spread rapidly through the wind , and the whole scene was filled with smoke , which reduced the visibility of the road section of nearly 50 meters and seriously affected highway traffic safety . seeing this situation , the road members immediately set up warning areas to remind passing vehicles to slow down and pay attention to safety , and at the same time quickly took out the vehicle 's spare fire extinguisher and the free - handed branch to make a fire extinguishing tool , braving the burning fire and the dense smoke fire source to extinguish . however , due to the hot weather and the excessive wind , the extinguished place was revived again . after nearly half an hour of hard work , the road members completely extinguished the open flame , preventing the fire from continuing to spread . afterwards , the patrol found the arsonist near the isolation fence not far from the fire . the road members asked the parties why they set fire near the highway ? the man said he wanted to plant trees on the mountain , because weeds were so overgrown that he thought of setting fire to burn the weeds . unexpectedly , the fire was too large , until the road members and maintenance personnel arrived at the scene , the fire was extinguished . the road members conducted propaganda and education to the parties and informed them of the hazards of arson near high speed . next , the liuyang road administration brigade will use the " road administration propaganda month " as an opportunity to increase the propaganda efforts of the villages along the jurisdiction , so that the general public along the highway will further understand the relevant laws and regulations , and enhance the road traffic safety awareness of the residents along the road .

recently , the shandong provincial commission for discipline inspection reported five typical problems of non - compliance and non - compliance . among them , " pingyin county committee , county government and relevant departments and units against village tyrants and criminal forces that do not act as non - compliance " are particularly interesting . the two former county party secretaries and the current county party secretary of pingyin county , shandong province , were simultaneously held accountable for not conscientiously fulfilling their duties and allowing the village 's hegemonic forces to pervade the village and endanger one side . ( june 8 , china discipline inspection and supervision news ) for a county , the first two plus the current secretary were simultaneously held accountable in a notice from the discipline inspection commission , which is simply too noticeable . the same thing happened to the three county party committee secretaries before and after the same thing : they dared not take responsibility and act in the fight against the criminal gangs of the village hegemony forces . political ecology . the author believes that the accountability of these three county party secretaries is indeed very popular , and every party member and cadre must be vigilant against the " acquiescence " of this cartilage disease . " village tyrants " generally refer to the evil forces that blame the countryside . these evil forces include rural tyrants , rogues , rogues , and clan evil forces . they are rampant in the countryside , oppressing the people , and even worse , eroding the grassroots regime . therefore , in recent years , party committees and governments at all levels have made great efforts to rectify the " village tyrants " , eliminate " tumor tumors " for the vast rural areas , and work hard to create a grassroots regime with " clear temperament " . however , in pingyin county , shandong province , " village tyrant " has been running wild for many years , and even after three changes of the county party committee secretary , it is still " unmoved " , which not only makes the author wonder , but also makes the local villagers i feel chilly , because these " village tyrants " are not only rampant in the countryside , but also erode the grass - roots regime that should have been democratic and free for many years . from the reality of the " village tyrants " rampant , we can easily see the " indifferent " of the three county party secretaries before and after . they are not only ignorant of principles and positions , but also dared not take responsibility for the matter of " village tyrants " harming the village do n't dare to act and connive at these " village tyrants " . in the final analysis , these three county party secretaries all regard " village bully " as a " hot potato " that is not easy to solve . they think that " iron camps , running soldiers " will leave in pingyin county for a few years . why not what about the " village tyrants " to be rehabilitated ? as a result , " acquiescence " became their common attitude , and in the author 's opinion , the " acquiescence " of the village tyrants was actually that these leading cadres had committed " chondrosis " and dared not seek political power in their place . the " acquiescence " of village tyrants is infringing on the interests of the masses , and has got the cartilage disease of " acquiescence " . party members and cadres think of personal gains and losses , and forget the original intention and purpose of being party members and cadres . this is really not a party member . cadre . the author believes that since " in place " , party members and cadres must be vigilant of the " acquiescence " of this kind of cartilage disease , and use their guts and toughness to provoke the heavy burden of fighting for the people 's interests , dare to shoulder the responsibility , and even dare to act .

suo ju 's alimony court does not support \ nthis newspaper ( reporter ent_0 ) mr . ent_1 claimed that his biological daughter 's monthly income was about 50,000 yuan , but he had not paid attention to him for more than ten years and had not fulfilled his maintenance obligations . recently , the lawsuit demanded that her daughter pay a total of 520,000 yuan for 7 years of alimony , housing , and medical expenses based on her monthly income of 50,000 yuan . the haidian court finally ruled that the elderly daughter would pay a monthly maintenance fee of 1,500 yuan since may last year , while rejecting mr . zhao 's other claims . during the court hearing , ms . zhao explained that she had not ignored her old father . " although my father divorced my biological mother , i also performed maintenance duties on him . at the end of the previous year , i paid my father a one - time payment of 184,000 yuan . " ms . zhao believes that this behavior is enough to prove that she did not escape maintenance . the obligation , on the contrary , was that her father had failed to invest many times and wanted to pass on the company 's debt in the name of asking for alimony , so she did not agree to pay her father a one - time maintenance fee of 520,000 yuan . after trial , the court held that the amount of alimony should be comprehensively determined based on the number of children , income level , parents ' financial resources , and actual expenses required by the parents to maintain daily life , rather than simply considering the child 's income level . although mr . ent_1 claimed that he had no source of income , according to the evidence provided by ms . zhao , from 2015 to 2016 alone , mr . ent_1 established two companies in succession . therefore , considering various factors comprehensively , mr . ent_1 's claim that the amount of maintenance is too high has far exceeded his necessary expenses for living . finally , the court ruled that ms . zhao paid alimony according to the standard of 1,500 yuan per month . as for the housing and medical expenses advocated by mr . zhao , the court held that the elderly did not provide corresponding evidence for this part of the expenditure . in addition , the maintenance fee included the elderly 's daily maintenance needs , which already included the housing and medical expenses . therefore , the court does not support this part of the lawsuit . after the case , the judge stated that the children do have legal support obligations for their parents , but the legal support obligations should be capped by the actual expenses required to maintain their parents ' daily lives , rather than being used by parents in disguise to pass on debts . although mr . zhao 's daughter has a successful career and a rich income , this is not enough to be an inevitable reason for mr . zhao 's appeal for support . moreover , ms . zhao did not ignore him or take care of him as mr . zhao said . the judge reminded everyone that the remedy of judicial channels is the last resort to safeguarding rights . when disputes arise between parents and their children about maintenance costs , both parties should consider the issue from the perspective of the other side rather than sticking to their own interests . just like mr . zhao in this case , it is better to reflect on his own behavior than to support his daughter with his own daughter for maintenance , and to change it or encourage it . the harmonious family relationship is much warmer than the verdict in black and white . j151 \ nused to steal 22 slingshots and smashed 19 cars \ nthis newspaper ( reporter ent_2 intern ent_3 ) 29-year - old man ent_4 committed 22 thefts between november 2015 and april 2017 . in addition to the common tactics of hand - driving sheep and sliding door locks , dong 's most used method is to smash a car window with a slingshot , and 19 cars are stolen . the defendant ent_4 who was suspected of theft was recently tried at fangshan court . in court , ent_4 had no opinion on the prosecution allegations . ent_4 , a native of beijing , did not graduate from elementary school . he is a repeat offender . he has been jailed and sentenced to reeducation through labor . ent_4 said that he was working as a security guard in a community after he was released from prison . because he was awkward with his family and because it costs money to play online games , he only regained his old career .

( original title : the reason behind the accounting misappropriation of 9.3 million public funds to reward online female anchors is intriguing ) not long ago , the people 's court of jingkou district , zhenjiang , jiangsu province heard a case publicly . the way of rewarding won the favor of the female anchor of the network . so , what kind of case is this ? how did the defendant wang mou embezzle the company 's high funds ? the accountant suddenly lost 9.3 million public funds and disappeared in mid - february 2017 . zhenjiang police received a report from ent_0 real estate company , saying that the 29-year - old ent_1 of the company suddenly lost contact . after checking the accounts , the company suspected that he had embezzled millions of public funds . dong beibing , deputy team leader of the economic crime investigation brigade of the jingkou public security bureau of zhenjiang city : before reporting the case , the company contacted him by phone and said that we should pay the company 's account . we will do the audit . you will cooperate with us when the time comes . he promised very well at the time . it should be that the company contacted him the next day and the phone shut down . when reporting the case , it was found that more than 4 million people had no whereabouts in the company account . wang 's family and friends did n't know his whereabouts . when the police rushed to investigate , wang 's mobile phone suddenly turned on . he called the company and said he wanted to surrender . feng su , a policeman from the dashikou police station in zhenjiang city : this accountant ran to shanghai to meet the female anchor of our domestic betta live broadcast platform . the platform name was ent_2 . after meeting with ent_2 in the morning , i followed ent_2 said that i would go first and go back to zhenjiang . in fact , he opened a room in a hotel in shanghai and committed suicide by cutting his wrist . wang mou , who had no courage to commit suicide , was brought back to zhenjiang by police and real estate company staff . wang confessed to the fact that he had infringed on the company 's high amount of funds . after investigation , wang embezzled ent_0 real estate company 's public funds amounting to 9.3 million yuan , including embezzling hundreds of thousands of cash in the company 's inventory ; withdrawing cash from the company 's ccb card and icbc card , and transferring nearly 8.6 million yuan . the webcast watched the addiction and embezzlement of public funds as a reward . the police investigation found that wang was married and the family of three lived in danyang with their parents . the family conditions were average . and the high amount of funds he stole from the company was not used for his family , so where did this 9.3 million yuan go ? wang confessed that since he was in touch with the webcast platform , he has enjoyed watching live broadcasts . because his monthly salary is more than 3,000 yuan , it is relatively difficult to maintain family life , so he rarely received a reward at the beginning . he found that because there are few rewards , the female anchors disdain themselves , and they will only interact with people who reward more . wang felt that he had been neglected . in order to save face , he began to embezzle public funds to reward . dong beibing , deputy team leader of the economic crime investigation brigade of the jingkou public security bureau of zhenjiang city : at the beginning , i thought this was just as fun and exciting as playing games . one hundred or two hundred rewards , the female anchor ignores it , and later the amount increases , the female anchor will take the initiative to contact you , including going out for dinner , playing , he thinks ( the reward ) the more money , right psychologically , he is happier , more excited , more exciting . wang mou rewarded him with " a lot of money " . everyone thought he was a rich second generation . he was constantly touted by female anchors and netizens , making him feel very useful . in order to maintain the feeling of " popular stars holding the moon " on the live broadcast platform , wang constantly recharged the female presenters with high - priced " gifts " . on the most day , he recharged 500,000 yuan on the live broadcast platform . he made friends . wang mou did not conceal his wife and used the excuse of business trips to go to shanghai to meet with the female anchor every week and squandered the stolen public funds . dong beibing , deputy team leader of the economic crime investigation brigade of the jingkou public security bureau of zhenjiang city : basically all ( live ) the best hotels in shanghai , which may reach 100,000 , hundreds of thousands , and 20,000 or 30,000 when they are small reporter : spend 100,000 a night ? dong beibing : hundreds of thousands . not only to stay , to sing , ( also ) to go to high - end places to consume , buy some good drinks . i basically go every week . he has money in his hand . for example , how much money he took back from the company 's account this month is basically moonlight , moonlight family ! in his own statement , there are several female anchors in shanghai who have this relationship with him , eating with them , sleeping with them , which is equivalent to the situation of supporting nature . go regularly and then give her how much money a month . take money as a transaction . indiscriminately squandering someone to control financial matters . in ent_0 real estate company , wang is only an ordinary employee with a monthly salary of more than 3,000 yuan , not a senior manager of the company . so , how can he control the funds of a large enterprise in the stock ? time , splurge at any time , without scruple ? wang began as a cashier accountant for the company , but in 2015 , after the departure of the host accountant , the company did not arrange another person , but let wang be the host accountant . he alone controlled all the financial power of the company . dong beibing , deputy team leader of the economic crime investigation brigade , jingkou public security bureau of zhenjiang city : normally , there should be two people , one cashier and one cash accountant . this ( company ) is the only one . all the company seals and corporate seals are the same . people management . no one checked , he started a large amount of unscrupulous , from ( each ) 10,000 , 20,000 like this , and then directly to more than one hundred thousand . from 2015 to 2017 , wang 's company has not organized audit work , nor has the leader supervised wang 's accounts . dong beibing , deputy team leader of the economic crime investigation brigade , jingkou public security bureau of zhenjiang city : this company is 70 % state - owned shares , 30 % is a private enterprise ( investment ) , the accountant sent by the private owner ( wang mou ) , state - owned this side believes that there will be supervision on the side of ( private enterprises ) ; then on the side of the shareholders of private enterprises , it is believed that state - owned enterprises will supervise him , that is , both sides may have ignored this . ( cause ) he has no one to approve , and he can use as much as he wants . after 7 years of imprisonment , 9.3 million was unable to return the compensation . after the court trial , the court issued a sentence . the defendant wang was sentenced to 7 years in prison for the crime of occupation of occupation , and was confiscated 200,000 yuan in property . ten thousand yuan , but wang has no ability to refund . after the court pronounced the sentence , wang mou repented and did not appeal . the police learned that wang was usually a very introverted person . people around him said that he rarely made mistakes and had no bad habits . why did wang become addicted to live webcasts this time and could not extricate himself ? psychologists say that people who are introverted may lack extreme self - confidence because they usually lack communication with others . therefore , they need to find self and the affirmation of others in a virtual environment . when wang mou was dismissed by female anchors for being rewarded , he was psychologically unbearable , so he did not hesitate to steal public funds to reward ; and when he disguised himself as a " rich second generation " , he attracted female anchors with money when she was competing for it , her heart was greatly satisfied , and she was even more unable to extricate herself . ent_3 , national level 2 psychological counselor : in fact , these ( pursue ) on these networks seem to be a kind of glory , or someone 's affirmation to you ( actually ) are all virtual , all illusory , but they are given to him a psychological comfort . according to psychologists , a self - closed personality like wang mou is not uncommon . most of them were formed in adolescence . generally , they show that they have almost no social activities . in addition to necessary work , study , and shopping , they spend most of their time at home . , do not associate with others . if parents or relatives find such a phenomenon , they must conduct psychological counseling in time , otherwise they will cause young people to form unconfident psychological habits and affect their lives . ent_3 , a national second - level psychological counselor : to give him some family companionship , parents should give the child a sufficient affection , a sense of security , and also give him some encouragement , so as not to let the child become closed . in this case , real estate companies that have suffered huge losses should also learn a lesson . for more than a year , wang mou misappropriated and embezzled more than 9.3 million yuan but was never found . the company 's huge financial loopholes and lack of supervision objectively gave wang mou a chance to commit a crime . dong beibing , deputy team leader of the economic crime investigation brigade of the jingkou public security bureau of zhenjiang city : it is recommended that all company companies , financial personnel , including the company 's management personnel , must implement the company 's financial system , that is , implement it , and strictly supervise the use of financial funds .

inexplicably , shaanxi yulin man wang tianrong became a " criminal " . the i d card information showed that he was sentenced to 10 years in prison . the yulin branch of the yulin city public security bureau found that the department had made an entry error . the reporter recently learned from the ent_0 of the public security bureau that it had corrected the entered erroneous information . facing wang tianrong 's questioning of accountability , a person in charge of the branch said , " because the incident occurred more than a decade ago , it is not possible to make it clear , and the responsibility can not be determined . " with just a few simple outlines , wang tianrong 's troubled situation after being " criminal " can not be restored . according to reports , in the past 9 years , wang tianrong " basically encountered two or three public security interrogations every year , and now he has been inspected a total of twenty or thirty times . " because of the " case " , he " checked the hotel , could not apply for the loan , and even dared not go out to travel " , " dismissed by the organization for various reasons " , " can only do odd jobs on the site of friends he knows " , and " as a result , the child may not be able to go to school " , out of frustration , he and his wife " all are going to discuss divorce . " jurisprudentially speaking , there must be relief for any violation . the " police law " clearly stipulates that when the people 's police infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of citizens or organizations while performing their duties , they shall be compensated in accordance with the " national compensation law " and other relevant laws and regulations . since the investigating personnel launched an investigation and found the investigation paper , trial paper , and judgment from the yuyang district court , it was found that " the i d number of the actual perpetrator on the investigation paper is inconsistent with the information in the national information library of criminal offenders . the information is wrongly entered into the national criminal resource database for criminals . for such " fault " and " harm " of public power , as a citizen whose work , reputation and other rights have been injured , wang tianrong has the right to receive corresponding compensation , which is also the relief given to him by law right . in addition to compensation , accountability is also essential . in all fairness , it may be inevitable that the police misrecorded citizens ' information . according to the " public security people 's police law enforcement fault responsibility regulations , " " there are flaws in law enforcement in the representation of facts , references to laws and regulations , and the production of documents , which will not affect the correctness of the case processing if it is sexual and effective , it does not belong to the law enforcement fault mentioned in these regulations , and it will not be held accountable for the law enforcement fault . " but when entering the identity information , whoever made the mistake and who was responsible for the review , " should be included in the law enforcement quality assessment for supervision and " correction " is also a responsibility that must be clearly stated . relative to the error of entering information , it took nine years to correct it . it is an intolerable " inaction " , and it is necessary to " pick out " the responsibility together . according to the clear provisions of the police law , " people 's police should immediately rescue citizens in violation of their personal and property safety or in other critical situations " , " citizens should be asked to resolve disputes and they should be given assistance ; citizens should be alerted , it should be investigated and dealt with in a timely manner . " however , it is regrettable that we have seen from the report that wang tianrong , who is in deep trouble " swamp " , has not stopped seeking public power for help in these years , but the reality has caused him to repeatedly hit the wall . not only did the numerous staff members who had investigated him fail to lend a helping hand in time , they even reported to the location of wang tianrong 's domicile , but also encountered blame from different departments . he and his father reflected , " every year i will return to hengshan to the public security bureau and police station where the household registration is located , as well as ent_0 , yulin city public security bureau , yuyang district court , yulin city intermediate people 's court and other departments to consult how to deal with , " i ca n't even get in the door , let alone find the relevant department or the leader " , " i have n't known how many times i went " , " i have n't got a clear answer " , " things have been dragged on until now . " although the time has passed for a long time , things will not disappear out of thin air and will disappear . as long as you " shun the vines " , you can always find the original management department and personnel , and the corresponding " inaction " responsibility can always fall into specific people above . where there is power , there must be responsibility . something went wrong during the exercise of power , but later it was said that " responsibility can not be determined . " it is easy to make people think . it may be a mistake to confuse identity information with a rapist , but it has been a greater fault if it has not been changed for 9 years . while strictly pursuing responsibility in accordance with the law , it is also necessary to tighten the screws that regulate power .

i want to complain ! ! ! i ... got pregnant accidentally , because i was not ready to have a baby , so i went to the nearby " ent_0 western medical gynecology clinic " to do abortion . a female doctor with yellow hair in the clinic operated on me . i felt very painful . i suspected that she was not a doctor ... in january of this year , the law enforcement officers of the health supervision office of shenzhen guangming new district received a complaint from a woman , yingming western medical gynecology clinic conducted a surprise inspection . the health supervision and law enforcement personnel entered the clinic for inspection in two batches . the first batch of personnel conducted a comprehensive inspection after entering , but no suspicious personnel were found . as a result , when the second batch of health and law enforcement officers were preparing to go upstairs for inspection , they met with a panicked yellow - haired woman at the stairs . " i 'm just passing by to borrow a toilet ... " the yellow - haired woman panicked . she tried to escape from the scene several times and " tangled " with the guards for a long time before she was willing to cooperate with the investigation . a check really has problems ! this woman was the " yellow - haired female doctor " who was an abortion to the complainant at the time , but she could not get any medical qualifications . the on - site investigation by the health surveillance personnel found that although this clinic obtained a license to practice in a medical institution , the only diagnosis and treatment subjects allowed to be carried out were : obstetrics and gynecology and gynecology . at the scene , they also found : there is a b - mode ultrasound computer on the second floor of the clinic . there are ultrasound examination records of 21 patients including the complainant . on the spot , the prescription and charge receipt issued by the clinic to the complainant were found . a medical institution 's license does not mean that you can see anything . just like you have obtained a driver 's license of c1 and you can not drive a large passenger car . the practice license of the medical institution of the clinic did not register a family planning program , but carried out artificial termination of pregnancy for the purpose of birth control ; it did not register a ultrasound diagnostic program , but carried out ultrasound diagnosis . moreover , the name of the institution written on the ultrasound medical imaging report is " shenzhen clinic " , which is also different from the name of the institution stated in the medical institution 's license . is n't this too distracting ? ! in the face of these evidences , the clinic manager and the woman with yellow hair finally admitted to having carried out a pregnancy termination operation for the complainant without obtaining the corresponding qualifications . the clinic was eventually fined 115,000 yuan , and yellow - haired women who did not have medical qualifications to illegally perform ultrasound diagnosis , artificial termination of pregnancy and other medical activities were fined 20,000 yuan . warm reminder : when you see a doctor , you should not only pay more attention to the qualifications and scope of practice of the place , but also pay attention to whether the receiving doctor is qualified to practice medicine . keep the relevant medical evidence , and find suspicious places and personnel to report to the health supervision department .

in the results of the supervision and random inspection of the second phase of food and food additives announced by the state food and drug administration , the number of unqualified products containing drinking water in bottles ( barrels ) was as high as 791 items . the carding found that 98 % of the problematic products were barreled aquatic products , which has become a severely affected area for unqualified drinking water products . according to industry insiders , this is related to the repeated use of barrels by enterprises , accidents in transportation and circulation , and weak corporate supervision . especially driven by high profits , it is difficult for water companies to cut off barreled water in a short period of time , which further enhances quality supervision and the urgency of raising the cost of illegal business . why the bottled water is always " injured " the barrel is used repeatedly . regarding the frequent quality problems of barreled water , insiders said it was caused by various reasons . the industry sources revealed that the repeated use of the barrel is one of the culprits . according to him , buckets containing water are usually reused by companies , and each bucket can be used on average about 50 times . in order to save costs , some enterprises only rely on the original manual cleaning and a small amount of disinfectant washing , which can not meet the minimum requirements for the recycling and cleaning of bottled water , and residual pathogenic bacteria will be generated on the bucket . in addition , according to the regulations of the relevant national departments , if the barreled water enterprise reuses the bucket , its material must be a pc barrel , and if it uses pet material similar to the use of pc material , its use number is only once . since the cost of pet materials is only half of pc barrels , in order to reduce costs , some companies illegally replace pc materials with pet materials . however , pet materials will decompose toxic substances when they are subjected to high temperatures , which can not meet the requirements of recycling , which also lays hidden dangers for the quality of bottled water . bottle caps with loose circulation . luo tan , president of the guangdong bottled water industry association , believes that bottled water is also prone to loopholes in transportation . after loading , unloading , water store storage , door - to - door delivery , etc . , the bottle cap may leak air due to bumps and collisions , thereby being polluted by air and causing pathogenic bacteria . moreover , the lid of the bucket of water is recessed into the body of the bucket and the sealing is slightly poor . when the total number of detected colonies exceeded the standard , ent_1 reported that during the third - party inspection of the same batch of products and previous national supervision and sampling tests , there was no excessive colony in the bottled water of ent_1 . therefore , this time it was during the handling that the lid was loose or the barrel was leaking , which caused the total number of colonies to exceed the standard . brand licensing encounters regulatory challenges . due to the interlocking links and the large number of links involved , more stringent requirements are imposed on the production and supervision of the enterprise , but often the problem is caused by the unfavorable supervision of the enterprise . for example , ent_0 once authorized the use of trademarks to many water plants across the country . since ent_0 's factory supervisors did not work properly , the water plants failed to produce according to the requirements . unsatisfactory quality has been detected many times . bottled water has repeatedly suffered from quality crises . in the list of unqualified sampling inspections issued by the state food and drug administration , barreled aquatic products from well - known water companies such as robust , ent_0 , wahaha , and ent_1 are listed . the list of 791 unqualified drinking waters was checked one by one and found that except for more than a dozen national brands that consumers are familiar with , the rest of the products were produced by some local enterprises with low visibility . it is worth noting that the " trademark " column of 30 % of the products is blank . in addition , there are three bottled water production enterprises that have been verified as counterfeit by local regulatory authorities , and 80 % of the unqualified samples were found to be unqualified at the water plant . it is reported that the problems of these bottled waters are mostly concentrated on the unqualified test items such as the total number of colonies , coliform bacteria , and mold . and these items are also the key indicators to check whether the bottled water is clean and safe . " the total number of colonies and bromate exceeding the standard are the problems that have always existed in bottled water . in the established inspections of the relevant departments , companies will select products with no problems to send for inspection , which means that the quality of bottled water products is universal and serious . " an industry source revealed . the high rate of unqualified bottled water has always been a major problem in the drinking water industry . taking this year as an example , in may and september , among the sampling results published by the state food and drug administration , ent_0 , robust , lanjian and many other well - known brands of bottled water products were found to have exceeded the total number of colonies . for example , in the random inspections of local food and drug administrations in beijing and other places , the products of wahaha and cestbon were not spared . moreover , the bottled water falling into the quality crisis is more serious . why ca n't the bottled water be eliminated in a short time since the problem occurs frequently , why do n't companies abandon the product ? rotan replied : " bottled water market demand is still strong . " at present , the main types of drinking water in china are tap water , bottled water , quality water supply and water sales by automatic vending machines . a survey conducted last year by an agency targeting beijing , shanghai , guangzhou and guangzhou showed that 88 % of consumers chose bottled water . although there are opinions that due to factors such as high costs , unqualified water quality , and unclean drinking fountains , it is a general trend to replace bottled water with water purifiers . however , judging from the current penetration rate of water purifiers in china , it is less than 8 % , and it is almost impossible to replace barreled water in the short term . from an enterprise point of view , high profit drivers are the fundamental reason why it is impossible to let go of barreled water . the above - mentioned industry insiders simply calculated the book , " taking a large - scale enterprise as an example , the production of a barrel of water , including all costs of water , barrel , personnel , etc . add up to about two yuan , and the wholesale price can reach 6 yuan . the retail price is around rmb 10 , and the profits are very impressive whether it is in production or distribution . " the source added that in some large domestic enterprises , the performance contribution of bottled water usually accounts for 30 % of the entire drinking water sector . about . with the support of consumers and businesses , bottled water may not be eliminated in a short period of time . with the frequent occurrence of unqualified quality testing problems , higher requirements are put forward for bottled water enterprises , and it is necessary to strengthen the self - inspection and improvement from production to sales to provide consumers with safe and safe drinking water . in addition , all of the above - mentioned industry insiders said that from the perspective of government supervision , it is more important to increase the penalties for violations of laws and regulations of packaging drinking water production enterprises , increase the amount of fines , and increase the cost of illegality to deal with the frequent quality problems in the bottled water industry . status quo .

in the results of the supervision and random inspection of the second phase of food and food additives announced by the state food and drug administration , the number of unqualified products containing drinking water in bottles ( barrels ) was as high as 791 items . the carding found that 98 % of the problematic products were barreled aquatic products , which has become a severely affected area for unqualified drinking water products . according to industry insiders , this is related to the repeated use of barrels by enterprises , accidents in transportation and circulation , and weak corporate supervision . especially driven by high profits , it is difficult for water companies to cut off barreled water in a short period of time , which further enhances quality supervision and the urgency of raising the cost of illegal business . why the bottled water is always " injured " the barrel is used repeatedly . regarding the frequent quality problems of barreled water , insiders said it was caused by various reasons . the industry sources revealed that the repeated use of the barrel is one of the culprits . according to him , buckets containing water are usually reused by companies , and each bucket can be used on average about 50 times . in order to save costs , some enterprises only rely on the original manual cleaning and a small amount of disinfectant washing , which can not meet the minimum requirements for the recycling and cleaning of bottled water , and residual pathogenic bacteria will be generated on the bucket . in addition , according to the regulations of the relevant national departments , if the barreled water enterprise reuses the bucket , its material must be a pc barrel , and if it uses pet material similar to the use of pc material , its use number is only once . since the cost of pet materials is only half of pc barrels , in order to reduce costs , some companies illegally replace pc materials with pet materials . however , pet materials will decompose toxic substances when they are subjected to high temperatures , which can not meet the requirements of recycling , which also lays hidden dangers for the quality of bottled water . bottle caps with loose circulation . luo tan , president of the guangdong bottled water industry association , believes that bottled water is also prone to loopholes in transportation . after loading , unloading , water store storage , door - to - door delivery , etc . , the bottle cap may leak air due to bumps and collisions , thereby being polluted by air and causing pathogenic bacteria . moreover , the lid of the bucket of water is recessed into the body of the bucket and the sealing is slightly poor . when the total number of detected colonies exceeded the standard , ent_1 reported that during the third - party inspection of the same batch of products and previous national supervision and sampling tests , there was no excessive colony in the bottled water of ent_1 . therefore , this time it was during the handling that the lid was loose or the barrel was leaking , which caused the total number of colonies to exceed the standard . brand licensing encounters regulatory challenges . due to the interlocking links and the large number of links involved , more stringent requirements are imposed on the production and supervision of the enterprise , but often the problem is caused by the unfavorable supervision of the enterprise . for example , ent_0 once authorized the use of trademarks to many water plants across the country . since ent_0 's factory supervisors did not work properly , the water plants failed to produce according to the requirements . unsatisfactory quality has been detected many times . bottled water has repeatedly suffered from quality crises . in the list of unqualified sampling inspections issued by the state food and drug administration , barreled aquatic products from well - known water companies such as robust , ent_0 , wahaha , and ent_1 are listed . the list of 791 unqualified drinking waters was checked one by one and found that except for more than a dozen national brands that consumers are familiar with , the rest of the products were produced by some local enterprises with low visibility . it is worth noting that the " trademark " column of 30 % of the products is blank . in addition , there are three bottled water production enterprises that have been verified as counterfeit by local regulatory authorities , and 80 % of the unqualified samples were found to be unqualified at the water plant . it is reported that the problems of these bottled waters are mostly concentrated on the unqualified test items such as the total number of colonies , coliform bacteria , and mold . and these items are also the key indicators to check whether the bottled water is clean and safe . " the total number of colonies and bromate exceeding the standard are the problems that have always existed in bottled water . in the established inspections of the relevant departments , companies will select products with no problems to send for inspection , which means that the quality of bottled water products is universal and serious . " an industry source revealed . the high rate of unqualified bottled water has always been a major problem in the drinking water industry . taking this year as an example , in may and september , among the sampling results published by the state food and drug administration , ent_0 , robust , lanjian and many other well - known brands of bottled water products were found to have exceeded the total number of colonies . for example , in the random inspections of local food and drug administrations in beijing and other places , the products of wahaha and cestbon were not spared . moreover , the bottled water falling into the quality crisis is more serious . why ca n't the bottled water be eliminated in a short time since the problem occurs frequently , why do n't companies abandon the product ? rotan replied : " bottled water market demand is still strong . " at present , the main types of drinking water in china are tap water , bottled water , quality water supply and water sales by automatic vending machines . a survey conducted last year by an agency targeting beijing , shanghai , guangzhou and guangzhou showed that 88 % of consumers chose bottled water . although there are opinions that due to factors such as high costs , unqualified water quality , and unclean drinking fountains , it is a general trend to replace bottled water with water purifiers . however , judging from the current penetration rate of water purifiers in china , it is less than 8 % , and it is almost impossible to replace barreled water in the short term . from an enterprise point of view , high profit drivers are the fundamental reason why it is impossible to let go of barreled water . the above - mentioned industry insiders simply calculated the book , " taking a large - scale enterprise as an example , the production of a barrel of water , including all costs of water , barrel , personnel , etc . add up to about two yuan , and the wholesale price can reach 6 yuan . the retail price is around rmb 10 , and the profits are very impressive whether it is in production or distribution . " the source added that in some large domestic enterprises , the performance contribution of bottled water usually accounts for 30 % of the entire drinking water sector . about . with the support of consumers and businesses , bottled water may not be eliminated in a short period of time . with the frequent occurrence of unqualified quality testing problems , higher requirements are put forward for bottled water enterprises , and it is necessary to strengthen the self - inspection and improvement from production to sales to provide consumers with safe and safe drinking water . in addition , all of the above - mentioned industry insiders said that from the perspective of government supervision , it is more important to increase the penalties for violations of laws and regulations of packaging drinking water production enterprises , increase the amount of fines , and increase the cost of illegality to deal with the frequent quality problems in the bottled water industry . status quo .

after the husband owed a huge amount of debt , the wife who passed away was forced to repay the debt . recently , the citizen ms . sun told us that the " jiujiang zero distance " column said that her husband borrowed a sum of money from others for doing business many years ago . for years , she has been harassed by creditors , not knowing what to do . in 2010 , when ms . sun 's husband wanted to open a company , he used a unique house as a guarantee and borrowed 300,000 yuan from pan . although ms . sun did not support her husband 's practice at the time , she finally compromised . " he did n't have any money at the time , he said that he would mortgage the house , so he forced me to take me to the notary office to sign . at that time , i was a housewife who did n't understand these , so he said that you can sign it . anyway , this house is mine you do n't have to pay it back , " citizen ms . sun said . a few months later , ms . sun often received calls for debt collection , and found that her husband 's career was not smooth from the beginning . " at the beginning , my husband still had money to pay . in 2011 , pan always called me and said that my husband could n't afford interest anymore . i could n't borrow it from my mother 's house . i called , and i borrowed money from my family to give back to xiao pan . slowly , i became more and more annoyed , and i knew that my husband could not afford the money anymore . " ms . sun also said . in this way , ms . sun has been living a life of borrowing money to pay off debts . in 2015 , an accident made ms . sun 's life worse . " when my husband was crossing the road , he was hit by a 89-year - old kid and drove directly to the side of the road . at that time , he became a vegetative . in the second half of 16 years , ent_0 came to me to see my husband 's condition was not good , he said if you really ca n't do it , you 'll sell the house , and i 'll have a dim sum . i plan to sell the house and return 300,000 of the principal to her . at least the remaining money has a guarantee for me and my son . as a result , she disagrees , she must have interest . " ms . sun , a citizen , told reporters . in order to take care of her husband , ms . sun quit her job . during those days , ms . sun had to take care of her husband and children , and she had to find a way to repay her previous loan . but unexpectedly , in 2017 , the bad news came again , and ms . sun 's husband left this stormy family forever . " after my husband disappeared , she sued me and my son . the court ruled that i should pay back the principal plus interest for a total of 580,000 yuan . the 580,000 yuan includes principal plus interest . i do n't know my husband . how much interest was paid , so i do n't know how to get it . " ms . sun , a citizen , also said . after the defendant went to court , ms . sun learned that her husband had borrowed more than 300,000 yuan in these years , and the debts had totaled more than 3 million , which made ms . sun completely desperate . unable to repay such a huge amount of debt , the court decided to auction ms . sun 's house . " i said to the president of the court , if you want to auction the house , you should auction the house . anyway , this debt is originally my husband 's debt . because my son is going to take the college entrance examination in june , what should i do after the college entrance examination ? what to do . " ms . sun said . although the court has issued a judgment , ms . sun is still frequently harassed by pan for debt collection . regarding ms . sun 's current situation , the lawyer stated : at that time , the borrowing of 300,000 was notarized , and ms . sun was present and signed . this debt needs to be borne by ms . sun . for other debts , because ms . sun does not know ms . sun is not responsible for these debts . as for pan 's debt collection call , lawyer liu suggested that ms . sun can choose to call the police for assistance . " if it is because of bond debt disputes , they can be auctioned and executed by the people 's court ; if they are harassed in life , the parties can report the case and the public security organ will deal with it . if the crime is serious , it will also be handled by the public security organ .

) i see that the phone number starts at 0451 , which is also a landline number , so i dare not answer it . my phone kept ringing , and he heard it from there , so i asked where the phone came from . i was too scared to answer or press . it was found that wang shuxia 's phone had never been reached . the police on duty at the zhujiang road police station hurried all the way and ran to wang shuxia 's house not far from the police station . harbin city public security bureau xiangfang branch zhujiang road police station police bo yujia but no one answered in the house , other police forces left in the house immediately inquired her family and relatives contact information . the police rushed to find people and kept 130,000 cash . when the police rushed to wang shuxia 's house , wang shuxia was already holding a bank card and was going to the bank to withdraw money . subsequently , the police contacted wang shuxia 's daughter , and everyone looked for it near several banks nearby . in the end , at the door of a bank , the police stopped wang shuxia who was about to enter . after seeing the familiar police in the jurisdiction , wang shuxia realized that she had suffered a telecom fraud . the policeman on the phone is fake , and the arrest warrant sent by wechat is also fake . the so - called money laundering is even more false . if wang shuxia withdrew the deposit at that time , the fake policeman on the phone would further ask her to deposit the money into the so - called safe account provided by the other party , thereby committing fraud . harbin city public security bureau xiangfang branch zhujiang road police station police ai bai yujia reacted for a while , only to realize that she was deceived , and said that if it was ten minutes later , the money would be remitted . harbin citizen wang shuxia did n't even eat these three police officers at lunch , and ran to help me . i have saved more than 100,000 in my life . if someone cheated me , it wo n't come out for ten or twenty years , thanks to them . ! wang shuxia said that she was scared by the fake policeman on the phone , but she had no idea for a while , and she was almost cheated away from her pension . if you encounter a similar situation , call the police in time ! please keep in mind : if you have anything to do with the police , do n't talk about money ! as long as someone makes a fuss about " money " , whether it is asking for money or giving money , please be sure to guard against stubbornness , do n't make a move ! feel reminded to light up ! reporter : ent_2 , ent_3 editor : ent_4

video : free travel is really a " recipe " for undercover reporters who undertook mlm \ u0026nbsp ; \ u0026nbsp ; source : how ent_0 station dragged the bottom - level mlm participants out of the mire ent_1 " checking the third phase of the house and telling everyone not to stay downstairs ! " " the next job is cancelled , the salesman who has nothing to do leaves the community . " ...... turn on huang 's mobile phone , named " fishing enthusiast " in the wechat group , news keeps coming . from may 16th to 18th of this year , the hongshan district government office , ent_2 , industry and commerce , public security and other departments of wuhan city , hubei province jointly launched a special three - day mlm activity special investigation . a " big play " where mlm personnel and inventory personnel fought wisely was staged again . " the mlm staff learned that we were conducting a centralized inventory , and tried to ventilate the members . in addition to the wechat group , buying vegetables , whether the curtains were opened , etc . were all their signal signs , just like ' cutting leeks ' , it was repeatedly banned . " wuhan lu lidong , director of the law enforcement bureau of hongshan district industry and commerce and quality supervision bureau , bluntly said . in the face of an interview with a reporter from the legal daily , relevant experts pointed out that the investigation of mlm must not only insist on strict online , but also focus on solving the problem of " backflow " of mlm personnel at the bottom . the punishment of mlm behavior is really to eradicate the mlm tumor from the root . 175 fortune dreams . this figure is the " competitive result " of the concentrated clearing of pyramid schemes in the morning of may 16 in hongshan district , wuhan . nowadays , joint investigations are the norm in hongshan district 's crackdown on pyramid schemes . statistics show that as of april 30 this year , hongshan district has held a total of 4 deployment meetings of centralized inspection operations in 2018 , conducted 60 centralized cleaning operations , cleaned 45 key communities and key parts , destroyed 352 mlm dens and found suspects there are 1,260 mlm personnel . the reporter learned that mlm is divided into " northern mlm " and " southern mlm " . " northern mlm " exists to control mobile phones and restrict personal freedom . " southern mlm " emphasizes mental control , that is , brainwashing . wuhan is mostly known as " southern mlm " . its main feature is to deceive newcomers to other places in the name of inspection projects , package projects , and visiting relatives . good conditions , generally rent high - end residential , family - style living . " ' 1040 sunshine project ' is a more common mlm scam . " ent_4 , director of the ent_3 , introduced that the criminals were under the banner of " state permission , government support " , " investment of 69,800 yuan , and harvest of 10.4 million , " with " capital operation . " under the guise of " e - commerce " and " fund private placement " , it is essentially a pyramid - type money - sharing game , which is very confusing . ent_4 bluntly said that " killing " and " fraud " are one of the common tricks of mlm activists , playing " emotional cards " against friends and family , using their vanity and wealthy mentality to create a sense of satisfaction and achievement , and then achieve " leading the king . " the purpose of the urn . ent_5 , once a victim of mlm , later established the china civil anti - mlm association at his own expense . in 2004 , under the lobbying of relatives , ent_5 joined a jiangsu mlm organization , and the first line of development was his own sister . in 2006 , after awakening from the mlm scam , he established the chinese civil anti - mlm association at his own expense . " mlm is an economic cult . 98 % of mlm personnel will be the victims of this money - sharing game . " ent_5 said that many mlm personnel are socially disadvantaged groups . many people sell homes and land loans to carry out mlm , and ultimately lose their blood . wife ion scattered . in ent_5 's view , the biggest hazard of mlm is the poisoning of thought . " mlm not only deceives your money , but also poisons your thoughts . many mlm victims not only have a hard time returning home , but even lead to psychological distortions after their dreams are broken . " ent_5 said that mlm organizations kept instilling " money first " in the people involved " the concept of " having money is success " has led to distortions in their outlook on life and values . many people blindly pursued wealth , and ultimately it was difficult to integrate into society , even if they knew it was a scam . the reporter had previously seen at the scene of the concentrated investigation operation in hongshan district that among the cleaned - up persons involved , " post-90s " and " post-95s " accounted for a considerable proportion . the police said that most of these people involved came from towns and villages in second- and third - tier cities . they were generally not well - educated , lacked social experience , wanted to change the status quo of life , and did not want to work hard . after being brainwashed , they cheated relatives and friends to make a fortune . some people are not clear about the dangers of pyramid schemes , thinking that pyramid schemes are a legal act , and even think that they are " helping " relatives and friends to get rich together . governance victims in fact , compared with the blow to the backbone of mlm , the problem of governance of bottom - level mlm personnel has made it more difficult for front - line police officers to commit crimes . ent_7 , deputy director of the ent_6 station of the public security branch of wuhan municipal public security bureau economic and technological development zone ( hannan district ) , has been deeply touched by the rumours of fighting for more than 10 years . " for the backbone of pyramid schemes , we can arrest them , and they can be held criminally responsible . but for those low - level pyramid schemes , the existing law does not make clear punishment measures , we can only arrest and repatriate education , so that they dare not come as for other places in our place , there is currently no good way . " ent_7 said . according to the provisions of china 's criminal law , if there are more than 30 people in the organization and leadership of mlm activities and the level is more than three levels , the organizer and leader shall be prosecuted . " this legal provision has a higher conviction threshold , a lower punishment intensity , and lack of relevant punishment regulations for the bottom personnel involved in mlm , and it is more difficult to operate in detail . " ent_5 said that 30 mlm organizers and leaders need to be identified offline , the operation is very difficult in practice . difficulty in obtaining evidence is a practical dilemma faced by cracking down on mlm . an anti - communist who did not want to be named told reporters that the current mlm does not pass products , because there is no physical object , it is more difficult to obtain evidence ; for cross - regional mlm , due to the lack of linkage mechanism , it is more difficult to deal with . " we found that in some places , even when the victims reported the case , the industry and commerce pushed the public security , and the police pushed the business , and everyone blamed each other and talked to each other .

" the company 's subsidiary e - commerce enterprises are the few cross - border e - commerce companies officially approved by the chongqing municipal government . according to public information , there are currently 1,500 " bao ma times " in the physical stores under the cross - border platform , many of which are franchise stores , and they are still recruiting franchisees . however , previously , there were media reports that xiamen 's mother and infant store with a shop sign that reads " bao ma shi guang " was also investigated by law enforcement agencies because it sold infant milk powder without a chinese label , and the owner claimed to be a cross - border e - commerce entity shop . however , the report did not disclose the name of the cross - border e - commerce . in fact , regarding the sale of imported milk powder without chinese labels by baoma time , there have been many consumer complaints before , and the complaints have been reported through local commercial commissions , foreign trade commissions and other departments , but the response given by the relevant local authorities basically said that there is no problem . . 4 . buy infant milk powder as much as possible . do not cross - border haitao . in fact , cross - border purchases from china through regular channels , haitao milk powder do not have chinese labels , but even if this milk powder is genuine , there is a risk of not meeting china 's national standard . . earlier , nonsense had repeatedly reported that in april this year , the spanish police cracked a case of counterfeiting well - known international brand infant formula milk powder , which involved 8 tons of milk powder , as many as 13,000 boxes . it is reported that these fake milk powders do not add the nutrients needed by the baby , and all will be sent to china . it is conceivable that once they enter the hands of chinese consumers , how many babies will be injured . dairy experts wang dingmian and song liang said that this kind of fake milk powder can not enter the chinese market through general trade channels ( that is , the product label is in chinese and enters the chinese market after china 's national inspection and quarantine ) , but mainly through cross - border purchases , haitao enters china , and there is another way to smuggle into some maternal and child stores to sell in a very secret way . so what should consumers do ? here is no more nonsense , you can check out the april nonsense report " the most dangerous milk powder comes from haitao , 8 tons of fake international brand milk powder is ready to be sold to chinese consumers .

" how do i pay the money ? why did n't your court freeze my account to tell me ? " jingmou , who was on the phone , was accusing the judge . the " brain circuit " of this " lao lai " is indeed different , and refuses to repay . does the judge need to inform in advance of freezing his account ? on february 17 , 2017 , qiao was driving a three - wheeled moped , driving from east to west along a village road in shou county to the intersection of a street in shou county , and driving by jingmou from north to south qiao 's light truck collided , causing qiao to be injured and the two vehicles were damaged . the accident was confirmed by the traffic management team of the shou county public security bureau as qiao was equally responsible for the accident , and qiao was equally responsible for the accident . qiao mou was admitted to the hospital for treatment after being injured . according to the appraisal agency , qiao mou constituted three ten - level disability , 180 days of lost work period , 60 days of nursing period , 60 days of nutrition period , and the follow - up treatment cost was 12,000 yuan . the owner of the vehicle involved in the accident was anhui decoration engineering co. , ltd . , which had insured compulsory insurance and commercial insurance at the ping an caibao security branch , and the accident occurred within the insurance period . the court judged the insurance company and jingmou to bear the responsibility according to law , but after a certain involuntary performance , qiaomou applied to the court for enforcement . at 6 a.m. on may 29 , the executive officer of the shou county people 's court drove to a certain district in hefei . at 7:45 , he arrived at the location of the community indicated in the report clue , knocked on the door and learned that the house had already changed ownership . after various investigations , we hurried to another district in hefei . with the assistance of the property company , we determined the floor number of a certain floor . there was another knock at the door of a certain house , but no one answered . judge ent_0 turned over the debris piled at the door of a certain house . there were four shovels . jing was working on the construction site outside , and this tool should not be wrong . a pair of men 's black sneakers with no dust on the upper . judge ent_0 concluded that jing jing should be at home often , and may have gone out to work early in the morning . no one is home , shall we go or not ? after hesitating for a few seconds , judge ent_0 took out his mobile phone and dialed jingmou 's phone . the judge asked whether jingmou was willing to repay the money . jingmou , as written at the beginning , in turn questioned the judge why the account was frozen , and judge ent_0 could n't help laughing . converging his mind , judge ent_0 solemnly explained to jingmou that they had learned that jingmou had sold the residential building in hefei and is now at the door of a new home . the house number , the sundries at the door , and the water storage buckets placed in the corridor opposite the house were reported to jingmou one by one by the judge . when the house was moved to another place , the judge could find it , and jingmou on the phone became less and less confident . judge ent_0 pretended that yun danfeng was casual and asked if his wife and children were at home . this immediately changed the topic and expressed his willingness to repay , hoping that the judge would not let his wife and children know that the court had approached him . an hour later , jingmou transferred the full amount of the execution target to the account designated by the court . " execution also requires skillful " psychological warfare " to seize the weakness of the person being executed . when he sells a house and moves to fear that we will find it , we have to press harder and harder to make him understand that he can not run out of the court 's " five fingers mountain . " on the way to the next stop , judge ent_0 could n't help lamenting the psychological contest during the execution . faced with the difficulty of implementation , our executive officers really want to use 18 kinds of martial arts , use psychological deterrence , exert mental pressure on the other party , and force lai to perform his duties automatically .

taoist doctors claim that they can rejuvenate the elderly : the taoist card was removed as a fake . shanghai opened a " tao body " for treatment , with a five - day training fee of 50,000 yuan . who is " master yi yi " ? " , as well as the follow - up " four masters of yizheng who swindled money by organizing " health training classes " have been criminally detained by the ent_2 " , revealing that the " master yiyi " gang is named for opening a " tao body " to cut off births , illnesses and death 1 . the situation of secretly arbitrarily accumulating wealth . " master yizheng " was planted in shanghai ! so , what is her identity of " taoist " ? how is the operation of shanghai yizhen cultural communication co. , ltd . , which she is a legal person ? opening the " tao body " is obviously absurd , and what management loopholes are exposed from it ? the " taoist certificate " is false , the official seal is false , and the identity of the volunteers has also been removed . the reporter recently learned that the ent_2 received a lot of cash and bank cards in the guest rooms where the " master yi " opened the " tao shen " . on the handwritten papers of the gang , the amount of contributions paid by those who opened the road were also recorded in detail . the reporter saw the words " total income 15  5 million yuan 750,000 " written on one of the papers . the police searched the material in the hotel room . open the " taoist certificate " of " master yizheng " , and it is awesomely posted with a photo of her wearing a pure daoist turban with a cap on her head . " taoist card " shows : his name is " ent_3 " , the track number is " jingmou " ; in the column of " shicheng legal school " , the words " ent_4 " are filled in ; the current address is " ( shandong province ) shenqing palace , yiyuan county , zibo city ; the time of issuing the certificate is " june 16 , 2013 " . how about the authenticity of the " taoist certificate " ? the municipal ethnic and religious affairs committee sent a copy of the taoist staff certificate issued by the chinese taoist association in purple cover . the reporter found that it was very different from the " taoist certificate " of " master yi yi " . the purple cover " taoist teaching staff certificate " printed by the chinese taoist association issued by the municipal commissioner for ethnic and religious affairs . relevant officials of the citizen religious committee stated that the national " religious teaching staff recording measures " implemented in march 2007 provided : the religious group shall issue the religious teaching staff certificate to the religious teaching staff after the filing procedure of the religious teaching staff is completed . those who have not obtained a certificate shall not engage in religious educational activities as teaching staff . the other party does not have a " taoist teaching staff certificate " , indicating that she does not possess a legal taoist status . does " ent_3 " really live in shenqing palace ? on the morning of may 24 , the reporter contacted the yiyuan county ethnic and religious affairs bureau . after uploading the " dao moumei " taoist certificate , the county people 's religious bureau made it clear that the official seal of the " zibo city taoist association " engraved on the photo of " ent_3 " was privately engraved ; there is no taoist teaching staff named " ent_3 " . yin qingjun , president of the zibo taoist association , told reporters that " ent_3 " was not a local . he worked as a volunteer in the shenqing palace many years ago , not a taoist priest . because he often engages in behaviors outside the palace that are inconsistent with taoism , he was removed from the shenqing palace many years ago . after reading the jiefang daily and ent_0 reports , yin daochang thanked the jiefang daily and ent_0 for " promoting positive energy and maintaining the reputation of taoism . " the chongming registration place has launched an emergency plan and will implement severe penalties . after a series of contacts with reporters , chongming district the relevant department launched an emergency plan for shanghai yizhen cultural communication co. , ltd . registered in the chenjiazhen economic community . after investigation , the company was established on july 17 , 2014 , and was introduced by the investment office of chenjiazhen economic community . the corporate legal person is " ent_3 " . since the company was registered , it has never bought an invoice and has no taxes . why is such an abnormally operating company safe and sound for the past 4 years , and how is it regulated by market regulators ? in this regard , the chongming district market supervision and administration bureau wrote a letter explaining : " since 2015 , the municipal industry and commerce bureau has randomly selected the number of enterprises with no less than 3 % according to the requirements of fair regulations and random registration according to the enterprise registration number . the market supervision department carries out the inspection of the publicity information , and publicizes the inspection situation to the society through the national enterprise credit information publicity system ( shanghai ) . the company has not been spot - checked since 2015 . " the chongming district market supervision administration stated that the main criminal suspects such as " ent_3 " had been detained by baoshan public security department and ent_1 was suspected of related illegal acts . at present , they have taken " first to file the case and wait for the judiciary after making a judgment on the criminal suspect , according to its use of the company 's name to infringe on the public interest of the society , implement the strictest administrative punishment measures , and prohibit the company 's legal representatives and executives within three years from the date of the issuance of the administrative penalty decision as a legal person or person in charge of other enterprises , credit restrictions are imposed . " in addition , yizhen company has lost contact and its destination is unknown . at present , the economic community has communicated with the tax department and shut down the tax function of the enterprise in time . however , the reporter is still a little confused : if yizhen company has not been picked up by the " random shaking number " , and there is no reporter 's investigation and exposure , can the company continue to " operate " in this way ? identity information verification has not yet been opened , and it is difficult for fake " masters " to swindle and scam . it is difficult for reporters to combine the " lurking " in the wechat group , unannounced visits to hotel rooms , multi - party investigations and forensics , and the investigation and feedback from many functional departments . in the name , suspected of swindling money . after knowing some traditional religious teachings , " ent_3 " created a set of scams and recruited and recruited some of the " backbone " through the formation of companies and commercial operation . they use the general psychology of the public to pursue health , and use the wechat group , blog and other online channels to constantly " scatter the net " , or suggest or deceive , so at the same time as the " dao body " , xuan xu was also deified . it can mobilize mysterious " masters " such as yin yang , miao shou rejuvenation and so on ; and such a " master " name , in turn , has become a brand symbol of its self - raising value and arrogant wealth . with the continuous digging into the " dao shen " investigation of the " ent_3 " group , the reporter found that neither the city nor the official website of the national religious affairs department has opened the nationally unified identity information of buddhist and taoist clerks . checking , this has also become a factor in counterfeiting monks and dao , wantonly swindling , especially cheating in different places . cultivate scientific qualities so that the spirits do not " run and run the hourglass " some current " spiritual doctors " with ulterior motives are often dressed in traditional culture , striving to cater to people 's pursuit of simple and fast treatment methods , plus their deliberate promotion of easy learning , and the service attitude is " better , more attentive and more delicate " , which has led to the deception of many people . the reporter noticed that since the reporter sent relevant reports to the " yizhen taoist health consultation and culture consulting experience group " , although the number of the group has dropped from 235 to the current 219 , there are still " stubborn " people clamoring to china the association " appealed " , " accused " reporters , and wanted to " fight the lawsuit " with reporters ... the number of members of the " yizhen dao body health culture consulting experience group " has been reduced from 233 to 219 ; " . the state council stated in the " thirteenth five - year national science and technology innovation plan " issued in august 2016 that by 2020 , the proportion of chinese citizens with scientific qualities should be increased from 6.2 % in 2015 to more than 10 % . whatever way of thinking there is , there is no way of life ; what kind of spiritual sustenance there is , there are all kinds of judgments and choices . obviously , only by cultivating a scientific concept of health and correctly understanding and treating health , disease and even death can we not blindly hesitate to face all kinds of ridiculous superstition tricks , even if the " healing doctor " prevails , let the " healing medicine " prevail constantly changing the soup , his own spirit will never " running".recall that taoist doctor 's " dao body " cost 50,000 yuan : retired and no longer seek medical advice to open the " dao body " price of 50,000 yuan . it will only get healthier . children can learn and learn , and their academic performance can be greatly improved ; the elderly can rejuvenate and no longer seek medical advice . what exactly is this " master yi yi " ?

in the past few days , boss cui , a large lobster farmer in xiliu village , fengqiao town , nanhu district , jiaxing city , zhejiang province , feels like the weather in these days , and it ca n't get gloomy and sunny . on the evening of may 17 , part of the shrimp seedlings at his lobster breeding base died out overnight . since the police have n't given the result yet , the mood has n't improved . boss cui has a history of raising lobsters . large - scale farming started this year , with a total of more than 30 acres . the cost of prawns alone exceeds 100,000 yuan . recently , the demand for lobsters in the market is particularly large , and the market is very good . according to boss choi 's plan , his batch of lobsters will be available in july , so that he can make a fortune . something unexpected may happen any time . on the afternoon of may 16 , as usual , boss cui fed all the lobsters at the base . where did he know that when he went to see it the next day , he was immediately dumbfounded , and there was a dense circle of lobsters along the shore . if you look closely , most of the lobsters are already stiff and have been dead for a long time . some are still struggling , but soon ca n't move . there are also small holes on the shore with lobster bodies inside . boss cui hurriedly inspected the entire base and found this strange situation in the 3 areas near the road . seeing this scene , boss cui was half cold in his heart . the three areas were nearly 5 acres of land . a total of more than 31,000 shrimp seedlings were all dead , and no one could be seen . go to the bottom of the water with a net bag , all of them are lobster corpses . according to mr . cui , in order to improve the survival rate , buy a good price . he did not buy frozen shrimps . although the price of frozen shrimps was cheap , the survival rate was much lower . so he bought all the local shrimp seedlings in jiaxing and pulled them directly in the water , but the cost was much higher . " even at half the survival rate , these three troubled areas can be bought in july for at least about 100,000 yuan . you said that my loss is not big ? " this morning , when i was standing on the tianlong to introduce to the reporter , boss choi has not yet been relieved from the brutal reality of so many lobsters ' overnight riots . after the incident , mr . cui 's first reaction was that it was caused by human factors . the reason for this analysis is that boss cui is not unfounded . first of all , the lobster in the afternoon of may 16 is still good , there is no sign of abnormality ; second , if it is caused by feeding , why is it not the lobster of the entire base died ; third , the water he usually irrigates is pumped by a nearby river there are no ditches connected to other water sources . if it is a water source problem , it is not the entire base . " someone said to me whether these shrimps had just been released . it did n't take long before the new environment caused them . i said that this was not possible . the shrimps that had just been placed generally lasted for more than two days . dead , they are particularly capable of adapting to the environment . besides , why is there only a problem with the area near the roadside ? " boss cui 's reason is very good . he insisted that there must have been intentional sabotage . " i have an idea in my heart , but there is no evidence that is not easy to say . " after the incident , there was a phenomenon that was very strange , that is , there is nothing wrong with the fish and loach inside , and all are jumping around . in this situation , boss cui analyzed that there is a pesticide called moth chrysanthemum resin , lobster is very afraid , put a few drops into nuoda shrimp pond , the lobster can not stand it immediately , but there is no problem with the fish . after finding out that the situation was wrong that day , boss cui called the police immediately . the police of fengqiao police station and the criminal investigation brigade of ent_0 immediately rushed to the scene to investigate and collect evidence . this afternoon , the reporter called the relevant person in charge of the criminal investigation brigade of the nanhu district public security branch to understand the situation of the case . it said that it is still under investigation and there is no result yet . source : collection of agricultural wealth , author : agricultural wealth collection - new fishing nets reporters ent_1 , yang yahui contributor correspondent suxi

( ii ) wu yi 's separate corruption part . from december 2011 to december 2012 , wu yi used the direct management of logistics during the period as the person in charge of the new city west district office ( including the preparatory team ) of the human resources and social security bureau of yangzhou city . the position is convenient . during the official reception of the unit , yangzhou tiandi wine co. , ltd . and yangzhou fengzheng economic and trade co. , ltd . were asked to issue consumer invoices for many times , embezzling public funds totaling 11,000 yuan . during the court trial , ent_4 did not dispute the main criminal facts accused by the public prosecution agency of co - corruption with wu yi , but the defendant 's deception was dictated by wu yi ; wu yi had an interrogation record and three interrogations at the beginning of the case the transcript and the book of confession admit the fact that ent_4 defrauded the surrender of the insurance policy and earned 48,000 yuan from it . on january 7 , 2013 , when interviewed by the jiangsu provincial people 's procuratorate , wu yi admitted that ent_4 had given him rmb 48,000 during 2009 , and the money was given because she had defended ent_4 and gave her blank credentials . sign without review . " later included in the court trial , wu yi turned over his confession , denied the fact that he participated in ent_4 's fraudulent withdrawal of the guaranty money and stolen it , believed that he was only negligent in his work , and failed to fulfill the review obligation , and that his guilty confession was due to his fatigue trial and trance the illegal evidence should be excluded . the people 's court of jiangdu district in yangzhou city held that the four guilty confessions of the defendant wu yi at the beginning of the case did not have the force of proof because the investigating organ violated relevant regulations when obtaining evidence . however , wu yi 's guilty confession made before the jiangsu provincial people 's procuratorate 's pre - trial arrest did not violate relevant regulations and had the effect of proof . the defendants wu yi and ent_4 , as public officials in state institutions , used the convenience of their duties to pretend to be surrendered personnel , fabricated settlement vouchers , and embezzled more than 220,000 yuan of national social security funds . joint crime . ent_4 confessed the facts of the crime truthfully after the incident , confessed his confession , and withdrew all the stolen money after the incident , so he could be given a lighter punishment according to law . wu yi refused to plead guilty in court , so this sentence was considered in sentencing . accordingly , the people 's court of jiangdu district , yangzhou city , in accordance with article 382 , paragraph 1 , article 383 , paragraph 1 ( 1 ) , article 25 , paragraph 1 of the criminal law of the people 's republic of china paragraph 1 , article 67 , paragraph 3 , article 55 , paragraph 1 , and article 56 , paragraph 1 , the defendant wu yi was sentenced to 12 years ' imprisonment for deprivation of political rights for two years , confiscated rmb 50,000 of property ; sentenced the defendant ent_4 to 10 years ' imprisonment for embezzlement and deprived him of political rights for two years . after the first - instance verdict , the defendants wu yi and ent_4 both appealed to the yangzhou intermediate people 's court . the reason for wu yi 's appeal is that the transcript of the jiangsu provincial people 's procuratorate on january 7 , 2013 is also illegal evidence and should be excluded ; even if it does not exclude the transcript of the jiangsu procuratorate 's review , the first - instance decision found that wu yi and ent_4 were not clear about the corruption there is insufficient evidence to exclude the reasonable doubt that ent_4 committed the crime alone or with others other than wu yi . the reason for ent_4 's appeal is that he was an accomplice in a joint crime . the yangzhou intermediate people 's court held that the appellants wu yi and ent_4 , as public officials in state institutions , used the convenience of their duties to impersonate the surrenders , fictitious settlement vouchers , and embezzled more than 220,000 yuan of national social security funds . all constitute corruption crimes and are joint crimes . ent_4 has carried out most of the acts of common corruption such as filling in false settlement vouchers , instructing others to take stolen money , and distribute stolen money . it plays a major role in joint crimes and is the principal offender ; wu yi has a smaller role in joint crimes than ent_4 and is an accessory . penalties should be reduced according to law . ent_4 had truthfully explained his main crime facts to the unit before the incident , and also truthfully confessed the crime facts after the incident . he surrendered himself and could reduce the punishment according to law , and he had withdrawn all the stolen money and could be given a lighter punishment . wu yi refused to plead guilty and considered this plot in sentencing . the original judgment found that the facts were clear and the evidence was sufficient , but the sentence was improper and should be corrected.accordingly , the appellant wu yi was convicted of corruption and sentenced to five years and six months in prison and confiscation of property of rmb 30,000 ; the appellant ent_4 was convicted of corruption and sentenced to five years in prison and was confiscated of property of rmb 20,000 yuan . second , the main question 1 . is the accused confessions obtained by the investigating agency through fatigue trials as illegal evidence ? 2 . does the illegal evidence have an impact on the measurement of criminal reality ? 3 . reasons for the judgment this case is a joint crime . the defendant ent_4 has been stabilizing the basic facts of her and the defendant wu yi 's joint corruption . wu yi also truthfully explained the basic facts of her partner and ent_4 's joint corruption at the beginning of the case , but later turned over the confession . after the review of wu yi 's guilty statement at the beginning of the case , the court considered it to be illegal verbal evidence , which should be excluded and not used as the basis for final determination . the main reasons are as follows : ( 1 ) the guilty confession obtained through fatigue trial is illegal evidence , which should be excluded . wu yi presented in court when the first trial was held , and the four guilty confessions made at the beginning of the case were subject to fatigue trial by the investigating agency , made in a trance situation is illegal evidence . afterwards , when the people 's procuratorate of jiangsu province reviewed the arrested personnel for review , because of the presence of the investigators in the previous period , their psychological interference was caused , and the repeated guilty confession still belongs to illegal evidence and should be excluded . wu yi and his defenders provided their time of arrival and the time of several interrogations at the beginning of the case to prove that the investigating agency had carried out a long fatigue trial . after a preliminary review , the court of first instance decided that it was necessary to start the procedure of investigating the legality of evidence . the court decided to suspend the court investigation , start the process of excluding illegal evidence , and investigate whether the investigator 's evidence collection was legal . to this end , the court played a synchronous audio and video recording of the interrogation process , notified the investigators to testify in court , and explained the evidence collection process . interrogation transcripts and synchronous audio and video recordings indicate that the investigating organs used the methods of " hands down " and " rotational interrogation " of higher and lower authorities to continuously interrogate wu yi for more than 30 hours , and wu yi was not given the necessary rest during the period , which was a fatigue interrogation . for verbal evidence collected illegally by means of torture , violence , threats , etc . , countries around the world usually provide for absolute exclusion . china 's criminal procedure law also adheres to this principle and absolutely excludes illegal verbal evidence . article 54 of the revised criminal procedure law clearly stipulates that criminal suspects and defendants ' confessions collected by illegal methods such as torture and confessions , and witness statements and victim statements collected by illegal methods such as violence and threats are illegal verbal evidence . should be excluded . however , whether the fatigue trial is a " method for extorting a confession by torture " and whether the confessions obtained by the criminal suspects and the defendant are illegal verbal evidence should be absolutely excluded . there are no clear regulations on relevant regulatory documents . in our opinion , in addition to traditional methods of violent means such as torture and bundling , other methods of forced confession in disguise , such as punishment stations , kneeling , and hunger , which are strong enough for physical or mental pain non - violent methods such as sun exposure , rain , fire , fire , strong light , noise , " wheel warfare " , and no sleep are also methods that should be used to obtain confessions by torture , and these methods of disguised confessions in disguise have become the main means of obtaining evidence illegally . to this end , the first paragraph of article 95 of the interpretation of the ent_2 on the application of the criminal procedure law of the people 's republic of china further clarifies the scope of illegal verbal evidence : " use of corporal punishment or disguised corporal punishment , or other means to make the defendant if the method of suffering severe pain or pain physically or mentally compels the defendant to confess against his will , it shall be regarded as the ' illegal method of torture and other confessions ' prescribed in article 54 of the criminal procedure law . " according to the regulations , we believe that fatigue trials should fall within the scope of illegal evidence collection . in this case , the defendant wu yi did not get the necessary rest during the continuous interrogation for more than 30 hours . this fatigue trial is a kind of disguised corporal punishment , and it infringes on the basic rights of citizens to the extent that the torture is forced to confess . the guilty confession made by wu yi in this case can not be ruled out that it was made against his will in the case of mental and physical suffering . such confessions are unreliable and belong to the evidence obtained by illegal methods , which should be excluded , and should not be used as the basis for finalizing the case . accordingly , the court of first instance determined that the four guilty confessions at the beginning of the case were illegal evidence and excluded them , which were not used as the basis for the determination . it should be pointed out that afterwards , wu yi 's confession statement made by the jiangsu procuratorate when reviewing the arrested personnel , because the main body of the interrogation was different , the initial investigator was not present , and the entire trial activity did not induce confession and forced trial . the factors affecting its voluntary statements no longer exist , so the evidence is admissible . ( 2 ) after the exclusion of illegal evidence , the amount of criminal cases may have an impact . according to the law , the principle of exclusion of illegal evidence solves the problem of the eligibility of courts for evidence . that is to say , only legally obtained evidence can be qualified as evidence . submitted to the court , the court will then examine the strength of its strength . once the court makes a decision to exclude illegal evidence , the excluded illegal evidence can not be used as the basis for the determination . however , the courts of first and second instance have different opinions on whether the illegal evidence will affect the amount of criminal cases . the court of first instance held that the four guilty confessions of the defendant wu yi at the beginning of the case not only included the fact that he and ent_4 jointly embezzled , but also included the facts of the initiation of the will , the division of labor between the two in the joint crime , and the distribution of the stolen money . combining ent_4 's confession , it can be concluded that wu yi and ent_4 's status in the joint crimes is equal , regardless of the priority . later , during the review and arrest phase , wu yi only admitted that he knew that ent_4 had embezzled and received part of the stolen money , but he did not specifically explain how the two persons involved in the division of labor and cooperation and how the stolen money was distributed in the joint crime . although the court of first instance excluded wu yi 's four guilty statements at the beginning of the case formally , he was convinced that wu yi 's previous guilty statements were true , plus wu yi had another separate fact of corruption and refused to plead guilty . the defendants were all principals , and the two defendants were sentenced to more than ten years in prison . after trial , the court of second instance held that since the excluded illegal evidence should not be used as evidence , of course , it should not have an impact on conviction and sentencing , otherwise the exclusion of illegal evidence would be useless and of no practical significance . in the statement that wu yi was found to be qualified for evidence , there was no specific statement about the filing of the intent of the case , how the second defendant divided the labor in the joint crime , and how the stolen money was distributed . ent_4 's confession that he was ordered to commit a crime by wu yi could not be fully trusted because of his interest in wu yi . therefore , based on the existing evidence , the two defendants could not be deemed to have equal status and role in the joint crime . on the contrary , a large number of documentary evidence and witness testimony confirmed that ent_4 has carried out most of the acts of common corruption such as filling in false settlement vouchers , instructing others to take stolen money , controlling , and distributing the stolen money , while wu yi only implemented the signature on the false settlement voucher behavior . therefore , the court of second instance determined that wu yi 's role in joint crimes was less than ent_4 's , and that his role was secondary , and found him an accessory . because ent_4 had admitted to her unit the fact of corruption after the incident and withdrew all the stolen money , the court of second instance believed that she could surrender . accordingly , the court of second instance reduced both of the penalties , and sentenced wu yi to five years and six months in prison , and ent_4 to five years in prison . after the judgment was served , both of them served the judgment . we believe that the confession obtained by the investigating organ through fatigue interrogation is illegal evidence and should be excluded . the exclusion of illegal evidence will not only affect the conviction facts , but also the amount of criminal facts . specifically in this case , if the excluded defendant wu yi 's guilty confession contains both conviction facts and quantitative criminal facts , while the guilty confession with evidence qualifications only contains conviction facts and lacks quantitative criminal facts , then there is no relevant evidence to supplement the quantitative criminal facts in this case , wu yi 's conviction can only be determined based on the confession . the court of second instance integrated other evidence and determined that the defendants ent_4 and wu yi were correct in their role and status in the joint crime . this article reproduces the self - proclaimed criminal case .
